importation of Parwaaz Hai Junoon as an opportunity to strengthen exchanges and cooperation in film industry between the two countries The principle to import foreign films to China was origins themes and genres in diversity Thanks to Belt and Road Initiative we have imported films from Pakistan and other countries so that Chinese audiences would have a better understanding of their history culture and people she said in an interview with China Economic Net CEN on Friday Parwaaz Hai Junoon is one of the top five highest grossing films of Pakistan It is a patriotic story mixing colourful song and

audiences she said In recent years foreign films with well written scripts and gripping stories like Chalard games goeng Thailand Contratiempo Spain Andhadhun India Perfetti sconosciuti Italy had made a hit in China winning both box office and public praise Therefore according to Xiao s experience Pakistani films could draw lessons from their ways of success into China s film market Hollywood and some European countries invest heavily in marketing and promotion for their films and the publicity of Pakistani films seems to leave room for improvement Second she said was to nurture audience The

in the past the U S would adopt a balanced approach towards both India and Pakistan an approach that is equitable that takes into account the national interests of not only India but also Pakistan he said in an wide ranging interview with Newsweek If that is the case if there is a balanced policy from Washington towards the continent I think Washington would find Pakistan a willing partner Ambassador Akram added Obviously Pakistan would like to have better relations with the United States and we would be looking to find the areas of convergence where we can work together with the U S he told Newsweek correspondent Tom O Conner Akram called the U S India strategic partnership a wrong choice but added nevertheless that s the U S choice Still he argued that improving ties with Pakistan could prove extremely beneficial for the upcoming administration Correspondent O Connor wrote that Washington s tilt toward New Delhi also occurred as nuclear armed India and Pakistan experienced some of their worst tensions in decades over their decades old Kashmir dispute India removed the special status of the disputed state in August last year which was followed by a severe lockdown that saw Indian troops committing human rights abuses against protesting Kashmiri people In the interview Akram hoped that based upon his past statements Biden as president would be willing to address these issues with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi In doing so the Pakistani envoy said the president elect could help prevent an all out confrontation that threatens the region We hope that with this approach of adherence to the principles of human rights and opposition to repression and all that goes with it Akram said that we will find common ground with the U S to help us to defuse the situation in Kashmir to help us in avoiding the danger of a conflict with our big neighbour India While the Trump administration s reactions to the human rights abuses in India administered Kashmir were muted there are indications that the Biden administration may adopt a more assertive stance according to the Newsweek report Biden s running mate former Senator Kamala Harris whose mother was born in India issued a statement during her campaign that We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world She indicated a willingness to get involved directly if necessary There is a need to intervene if the situation demands she said Biden s foreign policy adviser Anthony Blinken also brought up Kashmir during a July talk hosted by the Hudson Institute the report pointed out We obviously have challenges now and real concerns for example about some of the actions that the government has taken Blinken said at the time particularly in cracking down on freedom of movement and freedom of speech in Kashmir some of the laws on citizenship Blinken emphasized the importance of diplomacy But you re always better engaging with a partner he said and a vitally important one like India Akram in his comments during the interview hoped this translates into political action Hopefully if the Biden administration is open to looking at the reality of the Jammu and Kashmir situation and what the Indians are doing there he told Newsweek that it will come to the conclusion that it is important to achieve a political solution as well While Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has yet to bring up the Kashmir dispute in public correspondences with the upcoming administration it s likely to be at the center of future contacts between the two leaders Newsweek said In the context of Sino Indian tensions Newsweek report said the Trump administration s shoring up of regional ties has not been limited to India noting that the U S has reinvigorated the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue QUAD in recent years bringing together Australia and Japan in a bid to pursue a vision of a free and open Indo Pacific Such coalition building has angered Beijing whose embassy in Washington accused US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month of reckless smearing and groundless accusations But Ambassador Akram told Newsweek that Pakistan is not alarmed by these developments The QUAD is not a direct concern for us he said because we are not in competition for regional or global power We have no pretensions to be a major power He explained that he understood why the US would want to court a market as big as India s but that Pakistan was seeking assurances that the Washington New Delhi relationship would not come at Islamabad s expense We would like to be obviously reassured that such capabilities which are being shared with India are not going to be used against Pakistan he said and that they would not compromise Pakistan s national security interests And of course how Pakistan s national interests and how non security interests would be protected Newsweek quoted a State Department spokesperson as saying Our relationship with Pakistan stands on its own merits as does our relationship with India We do not view our relationships in the region as zero sum On his part the Pakistani envoy said that Islamabad s first priority is development and that the Trump administration s protectionist approach in attempting to counter Chinese President Xi Jinping s Belt and Road Initiative of intercontinental infrastructure projects and investment has been met with a cold reception in Pakistan Ambassador Akram suggested there is a real opportunity for expansion of US Pakistan relationship Whereas China may have an advantage vis a vis investment in physical infrastructure at the moment the United States has an advantage in investing in human infrastructure aside he said There is a potential partnership we would be looking at with an administration that is open to such cooperation with Pakistan This attitude he hoped would be extended globally as well reversing the Trump administration s unilateral exit from international agreements and institutions From what we see the Biden administration would wish to re engage with the international community the Pakistani envoy said to re engage at the multilateral level with international organizations in order to resolve issues like climate change to achieve more equitable development in the world to address human rights non proliferation He said that these issues require working not only with partners but also with rivals such as China If this is to be promoted there is so much more that could be done when the United States and China are working if not together but at least in tandem in the same direction Akram said If multilateralism does imbue the policies of the Biden ministration this would lead to some reduction in tensions resumption in cooperation at the international level and I think that would be good for everybody in the world NBBALUegbfq CIIE to promote Pakistan s exports to China Ambassador Haque The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Pakistan Ambassador to China Moin ul Haque

sustainable development in Africa under which the Assembly called for implementing the international community s commitments for Africa s economic and social development as well as national reconciliation transitional justice and social and economic recovery in countries emerging from conflict The resolutions were introduced by the representative of Guyana on behalf of the Group of developing countries and China The attempt to remove the win win cooperation phrase was defeated by an overwhelming vote of to NEPAD and to Causes of conflict in Africa In a speech last year at a summit in Beijing on China s Belt and Road initiative President Xi Jinping said the mega project was aimed at advancing win win cooperation among countries and build a new platform for international trade He said the next step in recreating the old Silk Road was to push the initiative toward high quality development with a focus on green infrastructure and finance Western governments have claimed that the initiative was a means to spread Chinese influence abroad saddling poor countries with unsustainable debt At the UN in a break from the common position of the developing countries India sided with the Western block in opposing the win win cooperation language The Indian representative claimed that they were not sure who is winning and said the concept was germane to a particular member state and to its political leadership Earlier Germany s representative presented the amendment which was later defeated on behalf of the European Union to delete the paragraph from the resolutions containing win win formulation concept which he said focused on economic gains at the expense of sustainable development needs He added that the term was undefined and not internationally agreed to In his response China s delegate said win win cooperation was an essential requirement for common development as well as an important means for advancing multilateralism Other countries however were putting their own interests first and politicizing development issues thus putting a drag on global economic recovery and growth he said The resolutions paragraph in question reads The Assembly Also reiterates that we are setting out together on the path towards sustainable development devoting ourselves collectively to the pursuit of global development and of win win cooperation which can bring huge gains to all countries and all parts of the world Both resolutions were subsequently adopted by the General Assembly with the support of over countries After the India backed Western attempt to delete the phrase failed India voted for the resolution while disassociating itself from the language on win win cooperation in the resolutions Diplomats say the India s attempt to balance itself between its closer proximity to the West and its purported leadership claim of the developing countries is increasingly exposing deep contradictions in New Delhi s position The Assembly met on

towards China The flight attendant of Pakistan Airlines introduced the customs of the two countries all the way on the flight When it passed over the main peak of the Kunlun Mountains the flight attendant proudly said This is K It is the border between China and Pakistan Yao had a very good impression on his first trip to Pakistan They are familiar with China s famous places even the

are transferred to Pakistan through Xinjiang Many large enterprises directly build production bases in Xinjiang Xinjiang plays an important role as the outset of the corridor Xinjiang should take advantage of its borders and accelerate the promotion of high quality development under the premise of ensuring epidemic prevention Especially in the case of the epidemic the autonomous region government began to make every effort to ensure the customs clearance of goods since February this year Xinjiang s geographic advantages can also build a trade bridge between Pakistan and Central Asia Highways are already very developed and Xinjiang should be promoted to become a link between Pakistan and other countries in the future Yao said The economy and development of Central Asia are highly complementary China provides Pakistan with this channel which provides a good platform for Pakistan to expand its foreign economic and trade ties and expand its foreign relations Pakistan can benefit from Xinjiang stability and development Xinjiang can also benefit from China Pakistan economic and trade cooperation and the construction of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor So this is a win win

Pakistan Economic Corridor faces new opportunities to boost industrial cooperation The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Since being officially launched in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC the Belt and Road Initiative s BRI flagship project has begun to bear fruit As the construction of the CPEC project has come into the new stage of promoting industry and industrial park cooperation Pakistan is facing new opportunities to fast track the development of its industries which can help it compete globally Industry cooperation has come along slower relative to other aspects in overall CPEC cooperation in recent years At the early stage of the project there were issues including energy supply shortage infrastructure deficiency and inefficient implementation of the incentive policies At that time some in Pakistan lacked a clear understanding of the direction of industrial development despite seeing the value building on the country s core competitiveness Since the s Pakistan has started the process to promote economic liberalization and the economy s opening up Joining the BRI and CPEC cooperation is part of the country s efforts in accelerating its opening up process In these couple of years the country focused on industrial park construction while try to undertake industrial relocation from China Now Pakistan has largely surpassed India in many aspects when it comes to economic opening up Yet its economic growth has not been accelerating substantially There are a few reasons Pakistan has yet to realize the significant achievements in industrial development The historically mainstay sectors of Pakistan s economy have been consumer non durable goods industry and light industry Modern basic industries such as iron and steel metallurgy heavy machinery and petrochemical industries have not been well developed and high tech industries also remain underdeveloped On the whole weak foundation and small scale are major problems holding back speed of Pakistan s industrial development Industries such as cement and automobile manufacturing have long been overly protected some analysts say Secondly Pakistan s economic development relies heavily on external markets but the dominant export industry the textile industry does not have outstanding advantages Thirdly Pakistan has low domestic savings rates and low domestic investment rates The Pakistani government attaches great importance to attracting and utilizing foreign investment but the level of foreign investment in Pakistan is significantly affected by the regional and domestic security situations Fourth low fiscal revenues and heavy external debt burdens have been major problems in Pakistan s economic development limiting the government s ability to invest The heavy debt burden has limited the government s ability to invest in public sectors Since the COVID outbreak the significance of the construction of the CPEC has become a key highlight for the country s economic development The construction of the CPEC will play a supporting role in Pakistan s economic recovery in the post pandemic era Pakistan should seize the opportunity to formulate scientific development plans to advance domestic industries with competitive advantages Speaking of China Pakistan industrial cooperation agriculture is the sector that could help Pakistan consolidate its industrial advantages and industrial chain and help the country quickly gain foreign exchange earnings through exports At the same time China should open its market to Pakistani agricultural products and fruits and expand imports of Pakistani agricultural and industrial products The textile industry is a traditionally strong industry in Pakistan When China s textile industry is shifting outward due to labor price rises Pakistan should seize the opportunity to use the advantages accumulated by China s textile industry to upgrade its own industry and accept orders from aboard In addition the Indian textile industry has largely come to standstill due to the latest resurgence of the pandemic and a large number of global orders have been transferred to other markets including China Pakistan should seize the opportunity of global value chain and industrial chain restructuring to develop its emerging industries For example since affected by India s increasingly hostile attitude towards Chinese companies many Chinese mobile phone brands in India have begun to move their factories to countries like Vietnam the Philippines and Indonesia This is also an opportunity for Pakistan The author is

cooperation and the construction of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC so this is a win win and mutually beneficial outcome said former Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Yao Jing Xinjiang should

Asia s economy and development are highly complementary and China has provided Pakistan a good platform to expand its foreign economic and trade ties and enhance its foreign relations he told China Economic Net In order to speed up the construction of the Belt and Road Core Area the Party Committee and the government of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have put forward a series of policy proposals put the construction of the China Pakistan economic corridor in a more important position and continuously promoted economic and trade exchanges with Pakistan to a broader space Xinjiang is bordered by Pakistan both historically and now culturally economically and tradeally he said He said in the process of building the CPEC almost all the people materials and equipment are transported to Pakistan through Xinjiang and many large enterprises directly build production bases in Xinjiang as the starting point of the corridor Xinjiang s important position is very prominent Xinjiang should make use of the advantages along the border to accelerate the promotion of high quality development under the premise of ensuring epidemic prevention In particular the outbreak situation the autonomous region government from February this year began to fully protect the goods customs clearance Xinjiang s geographical advantages can also build a trade bridge between Pakistan and Central Asia The highways in Xinjiang are already very developed so Xinjiang should be promoted to become a link between Pakistan and other countries in the future Yao Jing observed that from to was a period of consolidation and expansion a stage in which the economic development of China and Pakistan will really benefit the two peoples Yao Jing has always been highly concerned about the construction of the corridor I believe that Pakistan s support and participation in the CPEC has continued unabated from the supreme leader to all branches of government That is because the design of the CPEC and its actual role are entirely due to Pakistan s own economic needs and to Pakistan s need for improvement of people s livelihood From the s to the present Yao Jing has witnessed the stage of rapid development of China Pakistan relations In year old Yao Jing was posted at the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan and in his first five years in Pakistan he often dealt with local people From to Yao Jing

delivered directly from the country to Pakistan by special plane According to Yao Jing China s sincerity has been affirmed by the Pakistani people and when the Wenchuan earthquake in Pakistan poured in to help In support of China Pakistan has drawn up national reserves to urgently transport tents in the country s total war ready stockpile to the affected areas During Yao Jing posted as China s

that largely consists of industrial cooperation Although the Special Economic Zones SEZs planned under the umbrella of China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC are basically meant to relocate Chinese industry and investment but both the countries have already offered third party participation in the mega project The countries including Saudi Arabia Qatar Iran Middle Eastern states and some Western

since COVID outbreak The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Since the outbreak of the COVID pandemic the general demand for nutritious products and healthy food including organic foods has increased significantly worldwide presenting enormous opportunities for farmers and companies to tap into Featuring minimum use of synthetic chemicals that may cause pollution and maximum reliance on biological methods organic agriculture gains traction for its various advantages such as lowering environment pollution and land degradation producing healthier food reducing import of fertilisers and pesticides etcetera In Pakistan organic farming is still in its infancy stage with a very limited number of established organic farms Statistics show that organic land only accounts for of the total Meanwhile as a the second largest producer of organic products in Asia China may offer some lessons to learn in this regard Ningxia Qinlaoren Agricultural Development Company Limited is a Chinese wolfberry producer based in the northwestern province Ningxia Chinese wolfberry is a kind of fruit and a major tonic herb with high nutritional and medical values and it is also a key brand product in the region In the demonstration planting base for professional cultivation of green organic wolfberry quality is strictly controlled from seedling to plant growth Farm manure is used instead of fertilizer For pest control physical methods are adopted instead of chemical ones The company s products have been widely applied in healthcare and food businesses The organic babies snack brand GOOD GOUT China follows the same philosophy throughout its production cycle In our range of products for babies for example some fruit puree or yogurt instead of adding preservatives honey will be used as a raw material to give it the sweet taste Raw materials with high fiber and protein will be used and anthocyanins will be added to prevent oxidation said Offline Sales Manager Chen Qianying Amid the ubiquitous challenges posed by the pandemic organic food sector is presented with rare opportunities Data show that of consumers choose to increase spending on nutrition products after the pandemic and nearly of consumers expenditure on nutrition products has increased by compared with that in the past Previously mainly the middle aged and elderly people bought healthcare products whereas now more buyers of the post s generation purchase nutrition and healthcare products accounting for more than For different target groups healthcare products become increasingly diverse Pakistan also has natural endowments and resources so it is very compatible with the development of health industry said Sun Jiangwei Executive General Manager of BioGrowing Shanghai a company dedicated to probiotic businesses with products exported to countries including Pakistan Since the healthcare products of his company have entered Pakistani market In addition Healthcare products from Pakistan made their appearance at the China International Import Expo CIIE Pakistani enterprises can participate in more exhibitions to have more information exchange I believe healthcare products will have great market potential along the Belt and Road in the future he added Moreover the traditional herbal medicine of Pakistan can also play some roles Herbal plant products has been studied and developed by Sun and other Chinese counterparts which has the potential to distinguish from traditional dairy products by providing not only good taste but also good nutrition Organic products are often regarded as a high end nitch market In Pakistan only few are organic farmers The main reason lies in their premium price driven up by small scattered production which is a major factor constraining the popularity of organic food products But Dr Farooq Khan believes that if we do it on modern basis as done by China and other countries we will get better yield from organic farming in turn benefiting our economy So in my opinion such training should be promoted In particular if small scale farmers are equipped with sufficient expertise the potential of the small plots of land will be further unleashed overcoming the bottleneck of conventional dispersed farming and packing With the initiative of agricultural cooperation including the recently established China Pakistan Agricultural and Industrial Cooperation Information Platform Pak China cooperation in agriculture is yet to make a big headway For more organic products to be recognized and welcomed in domestic regional and international market a home grown certification organization that meets international standards should also be put in place to assess and label these natural products According to experts it will not only augment producers credibility and consumers confidence but also hold the entire community accountable for environmental implication and food security When BioGrowing Shanghai entered the Pakistani market in the development of e commerce platforms has been a tremendous boon In Pakistan a growing number of sellers are turning to online stores for direct marketing The ongoing digital transformation accelerated by the pandemic will provide more solutions to organic practices and businesses benefiting the entire agriculture sector NBBALUehbq CPEC helps create linkages with

The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed Chairman Senate Foreign Affairs Committee has lauded Pakistan Navy s Maritime Diplomacy as an example of Pakistan s soft power outreach and ability to bring diverse countries and navies on a common platform of peace in the Indian Ocean Region He was delivering the keynote address at the International Maritime Conference organised by National Institute of Maritime Affairs NIMA as part of the Pakistan Navy s AMAN exercises said a press release issued here Senator Mushahid appreciated the Pakistan Navy s

analysed two contrasting visions for the future of Asia There is China s Belt and Road Initiative BRI of which CPEC is the flagship which focuses on connectivity and cooperation with over countries signed on to BRI Conversely there is talk of a New Cold War through policies that seek containment of China led by the Quad of countries US India Japan and Australia Talking of Pakistan s foreign relations he referred to Quaid eAzam s vision of peace within and peace without hence Pakistan s expanding role in regional connectivity He said today Pakistan has strategic space with CPEC Pakistan s pivotal role on peace in Afghanistan India increasingly mired in its own problems due to Modi s shortsighted policies and a less interventionist more inward looking USA under President Biden Given this context Senator Mushahid Hussain proposed a point plan of policy doables to promote Maritime Diplomacy First since square kilometres has been added to Pakistan s seabed territory from nautical miles to nautical miles thanks to a UN ruling of the Conference of the Law of the Sea the Government must initiate and implement a comprehensive Maritime commercial policy with the Continental Shelf in the Indian Ocean as the core and Pakistan Navy in the lead role Second Pakistan should be the bridge between CAREC the country Cooperation forum for Central Asian countries and RCEP the country free trade agreement in Southeast Asia China is member of both CAREC and RCEP while India is member of neither That will open up huge economic opportunities Third in the wake of this successful Maritime Diplomacy Pakistan needs to take a regional initiative on related issues of Climate Change and Cultural Tourism which can provide a basis for regional cooperation on areas of common interest Pakistan is among the top vulnerable countries to the vagaries of Climate Change with South Asia s million people living along the coastline facing the challenge of global warming Onn Cultural Tourism he referred to opening up of Kartarpur Corridor for the Sikh Community the Buddhist historic sites in Taxila and Takhtbai as well as Hindu holy sites Other speakers in the session included Naval

with new vigour The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Despite the international propaganda move the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC project is moving forward by shrugging off all odds with lot of successes and new investments Although the year proved to be yet another period of misunderstanding about the CPEC all such negative campaigns are gradually proving wrong The campaigners utilize debt trap slow pace of CPEC projects and withdrawal of Chinese investment as their main weapons to misguide the people specially those livening in Pakistan A US based Magazine The Itlantic in its research article has termed the slogan of debt trap by China a myth The debt trap slogan is definitely aimed at halting the flow of Chinese investment to Pakistan and it was first used in Sri Lanka Although the country is in debt crisis but China has nothing to do with the crisis Dushni Weerakoon of Sri Lanka s Institute of Policy Studies and Sisira Jayasuriya a professor of economics at Monash University highlighted that China s share in the national debt was only Furthermore over of this loan is at the concessionary rate of It is only a myth that Sri Lanka has to cede Hambantota Port to China The same strategy has been adopted to malign CPEC without paying any heed to data or analysis on CPEC investment Such disinformation starts with reports of debt crisis in Pakistan and its weak foreign currency reserves It is used to stir fear among people The US magazine said Chinese banks are willing to restructure the terms of existing loans and have never actually seized an asset from any country much less the port of Hambantota Sri Lanka It added the Sri Lanka never defaulted and it was only a myth that the Chinese firms had taken over the Sri Lankan port due to non payment of dues Meanwhile another article published in a local daily newspaper said Pakistan was indebted to a number of international financial institutions including World Bank International Monetary Fund Paris Club but the focus of international propaganda campaign was only on Chinese investment and debts The article added that they manipulate data in such a way that puts all the blame on CPEC though the contribution of CPEC related investment is only which they intentionally ignore The same reports are highlighted and propagated through different media channels Innocent minds of Pakistanis are trapped through these reports Common people cannot understand the economic terminologies and the complicated debt data Talking about another false slogan the rolling back of Chinese investment the article added that the disinformation campaign has accelerated following the Covid outbreak The pandemic and its impact on the global economy and investment have provided a greater opportunity to manipulate data Thus it is necessary to understand the global dynamics before discussing CPEC Despite all odds and challenges amid the pandemic China is not sitting back While first half of saw some turbulence later China recovered and accelerated its investment Pakistan being the host to CPEC the flagship project of Beijing s Belt and Road Initiative BRI got special focus China started enhancing investment in CPEC and non CPEC projects According to official sources China and Pakistan recently launched two mega hydroelectric power projects valuing billion Further the ML railway project has also been finally agreed between the two countries and discussions are now at advanced stages The CPEC opponents are also trying to create confusion among the people about slow speed of the projects The evidences show that the CPEC is going on at a good pace rather the project has expanded over the past two years The setting up of CPEC Authority gave a fresh impetus to the project with expansion in the areas of cooperation The M motorway project was completed during that period CPEC helped Pakistan to keep of its workers engaged Gwadar Port started functioning as a transit trade facility The groundbreaking of Allama Iqbal Special Economic Zone SEZ was performed and preparation for the groundbreaking of Rashakai SEZ has been finalised Pakistan and China also expanded cooperation under CPEC First social development was added to the basket and China committed more than billion The programme will focus on skills development healthcare education and job creation In two memorandums of understanding MoUs were signed in the fields of agriculture and science and technology Besides China offered to donate a date processing plant for Balochistan The plant will play an important role in creating livelihood opportunities for the local people and enhancing export earnings for Pakistan Hence the campaign against CPEC is unjustified and does not have any sound footing It is suggested that the government should take immediate steps to improve communication about CPEC benefits for poverty reduction industrialisation and economic transformation The CPEC Authority is already working on it and it has improved the communication tremendously but there is a need to further accelerate the process NBBALUehf IPDS ink MoU with Association of Russian Diplomats

and values and a sincere desire to work together for a rule based transparent and just international system catering to the legitimate interests of all nations without any discrimination Talking about the latest preparations for the th China Pakistan Economic Corridor s CPEC Joint Cooperation Committee JCC meeting within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative Ambassador Haque said since the

The Balochistan Times Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi has said in cognizance of Pakistan s geo strategic location in Indian Ocean at the doorstep of the Arabian Gulf the Pakistan Navy was playing an important role to promote regional maritime security and good order at sea With the changing geostrategic realities in the region and operationalization of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC the role and responsibilities of the PN are growing exponentially The PN is steadily undertaking capability enhancement and capacity development to optimally deal with added responsibilities and evolving challenges he said in an exclusive interview with Global Times an English language Chinese newspaper During the interview navy chief shared his visions on Pakistan Navy s PN role in promoting regional maritime security naval cooperation between the PN and People s Liberation Army PLA Navy China and the upcoming multinational exercise Pakistan he said was blessed with an important geo strategic location on the northern shores of the Indian Ocean and at the confluence of three regions namely the Middle East Central Asia and South Asia This gives us proximity to the Gulf of Oman which is an important global energy highway as nearly of the world s oil shipments pass through this area Pakistan s percent trade is sea borne and most of our energy requirements are also met through the sea Pakistan s maritime advantage stems from our over kilometers long coastline and the potential offered by our exclusive economic zone of square kilometers and continental shelf of square kilometers which is increasingly adding to the national economy In my assessment the global geopolitical environment is undergoing an unprecedented transition remaining highly volatile and is characterized by new alignments of interests and partnerships Pakistan finds itself in the midst of a complex geopolitical and geo economic competition prevailing in the region Pakistan s maritime security is intertwined with the maritime environment in the Indian Ocean region which is rapidly transforming he said In our immediate neighborhood long drawn instability in Afghanistan simmers and continues to impinge upon regional security On our eastern side India with an expansionist mindset is destabilizing the region by actions that could imperil regional security On our Western flank the US Iran standoff has vacillated posing risks to ships plying along the international Sea Lines of Communication SLOCs The ongoing conflicts in Yemen and Syria are also impacting regional maritime security The warring groups access to shore based missiles and remotely operated vehicles is a serious threat to SLOCs transiting the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden Niazi said In the nontraditional domain and across the wider region maritime terrorism piracy drugs trafficking and human smuggling were some of the major challenges being faced now In short the challenge to our regional maritime security was an ominous hybrid mix of traditional and nontraditional threats he added To a question regarding Pakistan s initiative of Regional Maritime Security Patrol and its objectives Admiral Niazi said commensurate with the changing geo strategic realities PN launched the initiative of Regional Maritime Security Patrol RMSP in to fulfil its international obligations enhance maritime security and protect its interests in the Indian Ocean region with strategic autonomy RMSP was aimed at making seas safer for human use augment maritime security and contribute to freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean region RMSP sought to create a stable maritime order through integration rather than alienation Another important objective of RMSP was to foster partnerships with other regional countries and enhance interoperability On PLA Navy s development and its role to security in the Indian Ocean region he said the PLA Navy has shown phenomenal progress during the last two decades Today the PLA Navy has one of the largest standing fleet in the world and was operating state of the art platforms The PLA Navy has been sending its flotilla to the Gulf of Aden since which has contributed significantly toward maritime security in Indian Ocean region The PLA Navy s participation in various multinational exercises port visits and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions is reflective of its support for collaborative efforts to enhance stability in the Indian Ocean region The PLA Navy s consistent participation in Multinational Exercise AMAN since and conducting of bilateral exercises have been conducive to the overall maritime security environment in the Indian Ocean region Emerging new challenges to maritime security especially the asymmetric dimension of maritime terrorism are daunting which need a collaborative approach The PN and PLA Navy with their longstanding and expanding cooperation could play an important role in maintaining good order at sea The PLA Navy s presence in the Indian Ocean region was thus an important element in maintaining the regional balance of power and promoting maritime security he added Regarding the recent major procurement and modernization programs of Pakistan particularly from China he said the PN development strategy was based on progressive capability enhancement to create a balanced potent and combat ready force to meet evolving threats As part of this modernization PN was replacing its existing ageing platforms with acquisitions from friendly countries along with transfer of technology for their in country construction In this regard the PN and PLA Navy s historic and deep rooted relations constitute a key element Admiral Niazi said the PN has operating Chinese origin platforms since the early s Cooperation between the PN and PLA Navy in various domains ranges from construction of naval platforms to bilateral exercises training and high level exchange visits Naval collaboration between the two countries has been strengthened with the procurement of F P frigates fast attack craft missile helicopters and state of the art survey ship The PN has also contracted construction of eight Hangor class submarines four Type A P ships and medium altitude long endurance unmanned combat aerial vehicles from China With the changing threat dynamics and enhanced maritime security requirements induction of modern and potent surface platforms like frigates corvettes and offshore patrol vessels has assumed greater urgency In this regard Type A P frigates were being acquired from China These would be one of the most technologically advanced platforms of the PN Surface Fleet equipped with modern surface subsurface and anti air weapons sensors and combat management systems These ships would boost potency of our fleet and significantly contribute in maintaining peace and security in the region he added The contract for acquisition of eight Hangor class submarines was signed with China Shipbuilding and Offshore International Co Ltd Of these four submarines would be constructed in China while the other four would be built in Pakistan These submarines once inducted would substantially add to the offensive capability of the PN Fleet Besides these other major programs included enhancing our long range anti submarine warfare and anti surface warfare capability through induction of long range maritime patrol jets unmanned combat aerial vehicles and modernizing our existing fleet with state of the art weapons and surveillance systems They were also looking at acquisition of modern helicopters corvettes and shallow water attack submarines he said Giving an insight on objectives and conduct on PLA Southern Theater Command participation in the Exercise Sea Guardians in Pakistan he said the Exercise SEA GUARDIANS was conducted in the North Arabian Sea from January to This was the first instance that PN PLA Navy bilateral exercise was conducted under the ambit of PLA Southern Theater Command SEA GUARDIAN series of exercises is aimed at fostering interoperability and sharing professional experiences to deal with contemporary traditional and nontraditional threats in the Indian Ocean region The Exercise included joint maneuvers anti surface anti air and anti submarine drills The Exercise provided a useful opportunity to strengthen bilateral naval cooperation and promote safe and secure maritime environment in the region On Chinese defense minister s recent visit to Pakistan and cooperation between navies of China and Pakistan in this year he said PN and PLA Navy enjoy long standing broad ranging and strengthening bilateral relationship Close collaboration between the two navies existed across multiple domains including acquisition of platforms equipment bilateral exercises technical cooperation navy to navy expert level staff talks training collaboration exchange visits and port calls Both navies remained committed to expanding and consolidating this relationship for regional peace and good order at sea he added While commenting on reports claiming that PLA was mulling to build naval base in Pakistan he said the Belt and Road Initiative BRI was an economic integration initiative of China which would improve inter connectivity and usher massive growth across regions The ongoing CPEC a flagship project of the BRI would contribute significantly toward economic prosperity for all stakeholders Infrastructure development under the CPEC would create job opportunities and economic development for the people of Pakistan particularly in Balochistan and along the Makran belt The CPEC was a manifestation of strong and fortifying ties between China and Pakistan that would play a key role in the economic uplift and betterment of the entire region Gwadar is a commercial port that will serve as the lynchpin of the CPEC project As the port gets fully operational like any other commercial port it may also receive port calls by ships of different navies Karachi Port for example received ships of different navies quite often Visit of a commercial port by naval ships does not alter the commercial nature of the project Moreover PN was taking all possible measures to ensure protection of Gwadar Port and its seaward approaches through sustained presence in and around the adjoining waters off Gwadar he added When asked whether China s aircraft carriers would be invited to visit Pakistan he said Pakistan maintained close and ever growing ties with China which has been one of the most steadfast and reliable partners for peace in the region Chinese Navy hosts a number of modern and technologically advanced platforms in their inventory Operating with these modern and high tech platforms afforded an opportunity to refine our tactics and procedures The PN and PLA Navy held regular bilateral Exercise SEA GUARDIAN and multilateral Exercise AMAN exercises The PN would like to conduct an exercise with these carriers whenever an opportunity arises Moreover the PLA Navy and PN ships regularly visited each other s ports In the same stride the PN would continue to welcome further visits by PLA Navy ships including aircraft carriers he said To a question about initiatives being taken by Pakistan in terms of defense diplomacy with neghboring countries and major naval forces he said We are a peace loving nation and strive to maintain peaceful and cordial relations with all our neighbors and regional countries In line with this national policy the PN has been playing its role by actively engaging with the navies of all littoral states in the Indian Ocean region and beyond Admiral Niazi said the PN through naval diplomacy contributes to the nation s foreign policy objectives by showing Pakistan s flag in countries far and wide through key leadership engagements navy to navy expert level talks overseas deployments and participation in bilateral multilateral exercises on a regular basis In PN ships proceeded on deployment around Africa in line with the government s Engage Africa Policy A PN ship was currently on a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and goodwill mission

partnership to bring more benefits to Pakistani people and deliver more benefits to the region and beyond Chinese Foreign Ministry s Spokesperson Geng Shuang said while responding to the US State Department s official Alice Wells s allegations against the CPEC during his regular briefing held here The top US official for South Asia last week had criticized the CPEC a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative BRI and accused it would only benefit China and increase the debt burden on Pakistan The spokesperson said that the Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan had already responded to that accusation And Pakistani officials including the ministers for foreign affairs and planning and development speaker of the National Assembly as well as chairman of the Senate committee on foreign affairs refuted what the US official had said He observed that Ms Wells s remarks were nothing to add anything and added She just copied what certain people in the US said to smear the CPEC and BRI Geng Shuang said that both China and Pakistan had refuted such comments and clarified the actual situation many times But certain individuals in the US repeated their accusations Now since the US is so bent upon repeating their narrative I will also try to repeat what we usually say he added The spokesperson remarked that China while building CPEC always followed the principle of wide consultations joint contributions and shared benefits putting Pakistani people interest first Over the five years important and positive progress had been made in CPEC At least projects had achieved

aid and less than percent used Chinese loans Referring to data from Pakistan he said the total debt for CPEC was US billion which was less than one tenth of total Pakistani debts I am afraid the problem is with certain people in the US with evil intentions he added He said If the US wants to help Pakistan in its national development we hope the US will honour its commitments with tangible and concrete funding as well as aids instead of paying lip services alone The spokesperson opined that the US did not allow others to do what it failed to do adding I believe such mentality and practice are helpful NBBALUefbqi China UAE exploring opportunities for cooperation under CPEC The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times China and the United Arab Emirates UAE are exploring

and the exchanges between the two sides had been continuous in history especially the Silk Road had made these exchanges smoother Because of the Silk Road let us have more similarities to each other For example in terms of national character for example Chinese people are generous and willing to accept different cultures Pakistanis are equally hospitable and willing to accept different cultures Master Xuanzang of the Tang Dynasty came to Taksim to study Buddhism and brought the Buddhist scriptures back to China allowing Buddhism to spread widely For example in costumes Chinese silk spread to Pakistan and silk became an important part of Pakistani clothing culture For example on the diet Chinese food comes to Pakistan she added Whether it is a small town or a big city you can find Chinese restaurants because Pakistanis accept Chinese food There are many examples of cultural exchanges between the two sides For example in Pakistan Chinese people introduce fashion clothes and fashion hairstyles to us many young Pakistani people are learning Chinese she said We are a Muslim dominated country but different religious beliefs live in harmony here In the military government departments

said under its own Security Council resolutions must step forward and allow the people to exercise their right to self determination in IOJK The matter of Jammu and Kashmir he added was a UN

justice and equity and not through collision The response of the United Nations has been disappointing he said Beyond holding an informal session on Kashmir the UN has been complacent and according to

leaders in Turkey to play a role and act as a catalyst by using their influence with India to stop the killings taking place in IOJK He added that we also requested the Turkish leadership to pursue humanitarian diplomacy and explore any space to help alleviate the sufferings of the Kashmiris We have reached a stage that influential countries including Turkey should use their clout to move from

Corridor CPEC was one of the key trade routes that would connect China to the Middle East and Africa Under CPEC around US billion of new investments were targeted in energy and integrated transport

and both countries aim at raising it further The bilateral trade volume between Pakistan and China has now touched billion We aim at raising it further she said in her article published in China Daily on Thursday Ambassador Hashmi said that joint ventures in defence production have led to the manufacture of the MBT Al Khalid Tank and JF Thunder a fighter aircraft On the diplomatic front the two countries are committed to protecting and promoting multilateralism and upholding the UN Charter while our cooperation has extended to science and technology socioeconomic sectors and nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes she said Pakistan and China is historically connected through the cultural and knowledge corridor More than years ago famous Chinese monks such as Fa Xian and Xuan Zang travelled to South Asia modern day Pakistan to study Buddhism The famous book Journey to the West lists the names of areas in Pakistan like Peshawar Swat Taxila and Kashmir that Fa Xian and Xuan Zang travelled to Remarkably these days around Pakistani students are studying in top Chinese universities Likewise Chinese students are studying in universities and centres of excellence in Pakistan The number of visitors from China has exceeded the accumulated number of visitors from the rest of the world Ambassador Hashmi said that people to people contact and cultural exchanges have increased Hence despite different political systems social orientations cultural roots and heritage Pakistan and China are a unique example of civilizational harmony and peaceful coexistence The China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC is also a revival of the ancient Silk Road Thousands of years ago ancient Chinese traders went to Europe through present day Pakistan Today the ties are a modern day hallmark of deep rooted friendship Several power generation and transmission projects were launched under the CPEC s first phase Basic infrastructure such as highways railways airports seaports oil and gas pipelines and optical fiber linkages have been upgraded and strengthened In its second phase Pakistan is focused on spurring socioeconomic development and job creation Establishment of special economic zones and encouraging Chinese companies to join the Pakistani private sector for joint ventures will enable this transition As the agriculture is the backbone of our economy under the current leadership agro ecology has also become a major component of the CPEC The CPEC is inspired by President Xi s vision of regional connectivity and a people centric development model It fully resonates with Prime Minister Imran Khan s vision of Naya Pakistan and he believes that the CPEC is a game changer not only for Pakistan but the entire region Connecting Gwadar Port in Southwestern Pakistan to the Xinjiang Uygur region through a network of highways railways and pipelines to transport oil and gas presents enormous opportunities to people from Gwadar to Kashgar It is a testament to our resolve to leave no one behind and eliminate poverty It is indeed an agenda to promote human dignity and prosperity through development to build a community of shared destiny The CPEC has also made China and Pakistan viable economic partners for cooperative regional integration with opportunities for South and Central Asia s rejuvenation It will open new avenues for economic activity and create a trade pathway for China and the Middle East and Africa at large China has a lot to gain from this corridor as the shortest available connectivity route Thus Pakistan s significance will continue to increase because of the CPEC s centrality to the Belt and Road Initiative Ambassador Hashmi remarked that in the last seven decades Pakistan and China have exponentially developed all aspects of their bilateral relations However we have to seize new opportunities as the world enters an unchartered era of new globalization The stratagem of trade wars military posturing and unilateralism are threatening global peace and economic growth With the United States withdrawal from Afghanistan no headway on the Iranian nuclear deal upset in the Middle East Jammu and Kashmir becoming a hotspot the ongoing Afghan peace process and race for technological advancement in a rapidly transitioning world China and Pakistan need to maintain policy cohesion In the coming decades we envisage creating an enabling environment together for collective prosperity to promote regional economic integration and security cooperation To achieve that we must adhere to and continue our endeavours for equitable and just rule based multilateral system foster trust among all neighbours and create the political will to tackle confrontations Such interdependence can overcome geographical constraints for sustainable socioeconomic and security balance not only in South Asia but in the world at large Our strong bilateral ties must synergize with evolving regional blocs for sustainable development and lasting stability We choose to be partners for peace development and harmony she added She said as the People s Republic of China marks its th anniversary it is worth noting that Pakistan has unwaveringly stood by it for the past seven decades That true friendship is not just words but deeds holds true for Sino Pakistan friendship Today we truly are all weather strategic cooperative partners and each other s strength or as President Xi Jinping says iron brothers China and Pakistan has always enjoyed a close and mutually beneficial relationship since establishing diplomatic ties

projects worth billion in Baluchistan and a billion mega oil refinery in Gwadar which are part of the billion investment announced during Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman s visit to Pakistan earlier this year the minister said in an interview with Arab News Studies have been carried out by Saudi company Aqua Power Pakistani National Transmission and Despatch Company NTDC and other leading companies to look into hybrid or solar projects This will be a total billion investment the federal minister said During a visit to Pakistan in February this year by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman the two countries signed short mid and long term investment agreements worth over billion including for energy and petroleum projects Short term projects signed in February include two Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas plants for billion a billion investment by Saudi power producing company ACWA Power in Pakistan s renewable energy sector and a billion Saudi Fund for Pakistan Mid term projects include billion each for petrochemical and food and agricultural projects The long term investments are billion for the construction of the multi billion dollar Saudi Aramco oil refinery in Gwadar and billion for the minerals sector the report said The total investment comes to billion according to government figures released after the crown prince s visit Khan said the power projects in the pipeline also included a solar plant of megawatt at the Habibullah coastal power station in Baluchistan and a megawatt plant each in three other districts of the province He said the process of hiring technical experts for the Gwadar oil refinery project had started and would be completed in the next three months The refinery would have a to barrels per day capacity that would help Pakistan cut its annual crude oil import bill by nearly billion the minister said He said this was the first phase of Saudi investment in Pakistan and as soon as they will start achieving targets another phase of investment would start The minister said that Saudi investment would help Pakistan achieve its target of shifting percent of its energy needs to the renewable energy sector by Alternative Energy Development Board cleared the draft renewable energy policy last week in which we are taking renewable energy from the current megawatts to approximately megawatts by the end of and then to megawatts by Khan said Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in collaboration with Baluchistan s provincial government were also working to explore minerals in the province in a bid to promote indigenous exploration and production activities in both the oil and gas sectors Khan said We would be auctioning approximately blocks in the exploration and production sphere in Pakistan In this process we welcome Saudi companies to participate in upstream exploration activities Khan said Aramco is already working in the downstream exploration activities in Pakistan and we would welcome more Saudi companies to come in Pakistan for investment whether it is upstream middle stream or downstream He also welcomed Saudi participation in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor of energy and infrastructure projects the flagship of Beijing s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative It is a good opportunity for Saudis as well as other Middle Eastern companies to invest in Pakistan as it is next door to a big market like China the minister said NBBALUefag China Pakistan ties weather global storm Global Times The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The pace of shifting global alliances is baffling even the most avid international relations observers Big powers are abandoning their allies and developing countries are leaving their neighbors behind to partner with distant nations But one relationship has transcended generations As the People s Republic of China celebrated the th anniversary of its founding Pakistan has been at its side during all highs and lows The South Asian nation has been one of China s closest partners in the region popularly known among its people as the iron brother according to an article published by China s prestigious English language newspaper Global Times on Monday When Prime Minister Imran Khan arrived in China on October it was his third China visit in a year The changing geopolitical situation in the region and the world required taking each other s leadership into confidence and consolidating the mutual support built over the years A joint press release related to the visit revealed that the two countries have been on the same page on the biggest issues The Pakistan side re affirmed its commitment to the One China principle and clear support for the one country two systems principle The spate of violence that has plagued Hong Kong has been damaging the special administrative region s economy and putting at stake its reputation as a global financial center At such a critical time China s partners including Pakistan have come forward asking for upholding international law and avoiding interference in internal affairs China too has been cognizant of the territorial sensitivities of Pakistan The recent abrogation of the autonomous status of Jammu and Kashmir by India has been a major concern for Pakistan and came up several times during Khan s meetings with Chinese leadership While paying close attention to the circumstances in Occupied Kashmir China has stated its clear position on this dispute left from history It asks for a peaceful resolution based on the UN Charter relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements and opposes any unilateral actions that complicate the situation Another matter that has been a point of common concern is the predicament in Afghanistan where decades of war and failed reconstruction drives have left the country devastated Both China and Pakistan are making efforts to promote peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan Extending the China proposed Belt and Road Initiative BRI to Afghanistan has been a common objective of both China and Pakistan to spur economic growth in the war ravaged country The Afghan government has been interested in the prospects of linking the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC to Kabul via a highway through the Pakistani city of Peshawar Unlike what speculative reports in Western media point out CPEC is right on track The infrastructure network connecting Northwest China s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with the Indian Ocean through Pakistan s Gwadar is about to be completed Khan s visit was used by both sides to sort out the modalities of expanding CPEC into its second phase During this phase the corridor will focus on industrial and socioeconomic development in Pakistan by increasing projects that improve livelihood The development of special economic zones is also a part of this phase as construction work on several zones has begun Gwadar the terminating point of CPEC where China has built a state of the art deep sea port received special tax concessions days before the visit of Khan The move paved the way for industrialization of the city and lent encouragement to Chinese projects populating its industrial estate During the visit Imran Khan appreciated China s anti corruption drive The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has been the leading government body in investigating and rooting out the malaise For decades Pakistan itself has been battling corruption that has stifled its progress The present government emerged triumphant in the general election in with a mandate that found birth in the nation s frustration over the problem With several prominent politicians now behind bars the country s National Accountability Bureau has been extensively in the news for its successes Khan has been an ardent supporter of China s poverty alleviation program On the night of his election victory he addressed the nation in a televised speech and vowed to take a cue from the Chinese approach Speaking at the China Council for Promotion of International Trade in Beijing on October he reiterated his willingness to learn from how China brought million people out of poverty in just years The willingness to strengthen a relationship that has stood the test of time starts right at the top This visit was a true manifestation of that NBBALUefafl CPEC s second phase to focus on

on industrial cooperation agricultural cooperation and construction of Gwadar port and socio economic development of which new projects will be launched during the year During Prime Minister Imran Khan s visit to China the relevant departments of the two countries signed a series of cooperation documents paving the way for the second phase of the construction of the CPEC Cheng Xizhong Professor at Southwest University of Political Science and Law and Senior Research Fellow of the Chahar Institute Special Commentator told The Overseas Network here on Saturday During the meeting the leaders of the two countries pointed out the direction for the next phase of promoting the construction of the China Pakistan economic corridor stressing that the corridor should be turned into a high quality demonstration project to build the Belt and Road The China Pakistan Economic Corridor jointly established by the two countries is the flagship project of the Belt and Road After more than four years of joint efforts the first phase of the investment of US billion in projects have been completed and put into operation and some are nearing completion These major projects mainly related to energy and transport infrastructure were completely alleviated by Pakistan s long standing power supply shortage and partially created a smooth highway network thus setting the stage for a rapid track for Pakistan s future socio economic development Cheng said it is foreseeable that the scope of corridor construction will continue to expand and the pace will continue to accelerate especially as China will actively help Pakistan to carry out projects in the field of people s livelihood Cheng remarked over the years Pakistan has experienced occasional financial crises mainly caused by foreign exchange shortages The continued development of the China Pakistan economic corridor will gradually improve Pakistan s fiscal position For example the Qasim Port coal fired power station is a priority implementation project in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor which has contributed US million to the Pakistani government s tax revenue in the past year or so Experts estimate that the first phase of projects are fully completed and operational the government s tax contribution to the Pakistani government is likely to reach nearly US billion With the second phase of industrial parks and special economic zones it is believed that more and more governments and enterprises will recognize the huge potential investment value of Pakistan In fact in recent times Saudi Arabia and other Gulf

investment in Pakistan s industrial parks and special economic zones to build factories he added He said once advanced industrial production lines are in Pakistan Pakistan will gradually move towards

and construction as well as extending to the region If regional countries work together to build the South Asia Corridor all region countries will benefit and the region as a whole will become

Beijing NBBALUefad Peace in South Asia linked to peace in Afghanistan guarantees prosperity in Pakistan and region The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Afghanistan which was once known for its stunning landscapes and fresh and juicy fruits the world over now is a war ravaged country where peace seems an elusive and distant dream Over the last forty years the people of Afghanistan have seen nothing but a long chain of wars conflicts disputes and crises after crises the prolonged conflict and instability at home has forced a large number of people to migrate to the neighbouring countries mainly to Pakistan and Iran Thus a generation of Afghan people has grown up in these refugee camps while seeking livelihood for their kith and kin Geographically Afghanistan is a landlocked mountainous country located in South Central Asia bordering with Pakistan in the south and east Iran in the west Turkmenistan Uzbekistan and Tajikistan in the north and in the far northeast China The country has also plains in the north and southwest and has an area of square kilometers with a population of million people mostly composed of ethnic communities of Pashtuns Tajiks Hazaras and Uzbeks The longstanding Afghan conflict is complex as it is riven with deep schisms of a political ethnic sectarian and ideological character The conflict has run its course depending on two trajectories reduction in violence and some form of intra Afghan dialogue for a political settlement However reduction of violence will depend on a formal or informal ceasefire which is inextricably linked to the question of a timeline for withdrawal and the compulsions of the current US President For restoring peace to the Afghan conflict Pakistan has always looked forward for Afghan owned and Afghan led peace process as unstable Afghanistan is not only a security threat to the neighbouring countries but to the entire region and world at large The stability of both Pakistan and Afghanistan goes hand in hand and the way forward is through mutual understanding and good working relations Likewise the concept of improved regional connectivity prospects of Belt and Road initiative especially China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC will only materialize if there is an end to the political turmoil and war in Afghanistan The interests of both nations overlap peace in Afghanistan guarantees prosperity in Pakistan and vice versa Speaking at Islamabad Policy Research Institute IPRI on Pakistan Afghanistan Way Forward for Bilateral Relations Ambassador R Riaz Muhammad Khan said it would be better and safer for Pakistan to interact with Afghanistan on the basis of established state to state norms because this was a relationship from which we cannot insulate ourselves nor simply push aside He said that there were few examples in the world where people cross a border unrecognized by one side on a daily basis without any papers That in itself and the people to people interactions make Pak Afghan relations very close and intimate he added President IPRI Ambassador Vice Admiral R Khan Hasham bin Saddique said that the situation in Afghanistan had become a sordid affair evolving from infamous strategic depth to the current strategic mess He said Despite hosting more than two million Afghan refugees for decades the animosity that stems from Afghanistan is palpable Peace in South Asia can only be realized through peace in Afghanistan To meet such ends Pakistan has been making strides to play its role in achieving peace in the neighbourhood Ambassador Riaz M Khan while sharing his insights on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan to signing of the Geneva Accord said that Soviet withdrawal did not prevent continuation of the conflict the same is feared if the Americans leave Kabul precipitously He said The current peace deal is tenuous to begin with since it was pushed by President Trump due to his re election bid and past campaign promises It had limited support from defence and diplomatic heavyweights in Washington because negotiations without a ceasefire or reduction in conflict gave Taliban the upper hand He said that withdrawal without a plan of action to ensure that there is and will no civil war and the gains on the ground are not lost is unwise Pakistan should also have a policy of having no favorites in terms of future Afghan governance even to contain the mischief of India who will have to go through Kabul and Washington not the Taliban On India s presence in Kabul Ambassador Riaz said that India has its own nefarious agenda for the region which has nothing to do with establishing lasting peace He said that the future of Afghan peace now largely depends on US policy under President Trump and the Afghan elections Both are likely to determine the nature of Pak Afghan relations as well he added Ambassador Khan said that Pakistan s four decades of involvement with the Afghan conflict has led to monumental losses He said We missed out on opportunities offered by globalization ascendance of geo economics and the opening up of Central Asia Our aspirations for becoming a hub of economic activities for surrounding regions remained just a dream Instead we have been thrown into the vortex of extremist and religious violence and obscurantism ravaging the region especially the greater Middle East NBBALUefa new projects to be

Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The US is not the first country to offer to mediate on Kashmir conflict Former South African President Nelson Mandela and incumbent Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg had also offered third party mediation But India has paid no heed to any offer which has escalated tensions in Kashmir according to an article published by Global Times a widely circulated Chinese newspaper Perhaps India should try to understand why the international community generally supports improving India Pakistan relations through peaceful negotiations That s because during the more than years of disputes the two countries have always lacked an effective channel of negotiation Clashes have erupted along the Line of Control which had cost many innocent peoples lives Under such circumstances China has always supported international mediation because the peace and stability of South Asia is of great importance If the India Pakistan disputes lead to war or even a nuclear confrontation then the two peoples will become innocent victims China s national strategy and interests will be seriously harmed as well For example the China proposed Belt and Road Initiative will face severe challenges in South Asia if the region suffers from war China supports all countries including the US that sincerely aim at promoting peaceful negotiations between India and Pakistan because this is also in line with China s own interests China will always respect India s choice whether to accept international mediation or not However India should not deliberately ignore the international community s attention and will India is a major country in the region And if India and Pakistan can resolve the Kashmir conflict properly and peacefully India s national image will be greatly enhanced and its long term stability and development will also benefit The over years of disputes between India and Pakistan was something left by British colonization How India and Pakistan resolve the issue can help developing countries find a peaceful way to completely get rid of colonialism India should work harder to break the deadlock Since Pakistan and India are members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization SCO the SCO can provide a good platform for a regional solution The most important thing is India and Pakistan s will and wisdom to seek a resolution to the conflict

Friday a news article carried by some sections of International media titled IMF Won t Stop China From Turning Pakistan Into The Next Sri Lanka published in a section of press saying the article is based on incorrect data and distorted facts The writer needs to know that China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC is a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative Spokesperson CPEC ministry of Planning Hassan Daud Butt said in a statement He said CPEC financing comprises of Government to Government loans Private investment and grants To date projects worth US billion are in various stages of implementation of which US billion worth are private sector energy projects The Government of Pakistan s financial liability is only to the tune of US billion comprising of low interest loans and grants in infrastructure projects spread over to years payback period The Energy projects are being executed purely in the Independent Power Producers IPPs mode and finances are mainly taken by the private companies against their own balance sheets Therefore debt would be borne by the investors instead of any obligation on part of the Government of Pakistan The impression of debt burden falling on the Government of Pakistan is based on incorrect analysis Similarly stating that CPEC will add to corruption clearly depicts the writer is not aware that the second phase of CPEC is focused on industrial cooperation B B JVs socio economic development and agriculture cooperation directed towards poverty alleviation of less developed areas of Pakistan based on pragmatic planning and due diligence on both sides Comparing cooperation with China through CPEC with any other country is unrealistic as it has facilitated in overcoming crucial energy transport infrastructure and supply chain bottlenecks Under CPEC development of Gwadar mostly through grant interest free loans projects would ensure strengthening of maritime sector The development of Gwadar port project is on BOT mode and cannot be compared with any port project being developed on foreign funding loans Gwadar continues as high priority and is being developed as a standalone project as well as a transshipment hub based on blue economy principles All in all CPEC is acting as a stimulus to the economic growth of Pakistan The false narrative of a debt trap is not based on the ground realities Hassan Daud Butt added

s vulnerability index of the countries owing to environmental degradation and it s consequent catastrophes was number for facing extreme disaster events the Adviser added Speaking at the public hearing of Climate Change Caucus held here with Senator Sherry Rehman in chair he said The climate change issue has also become politically important where the two recent examples are worth mentioning here The Belt and Road Initiative Conference comprised two main sessions where one was dedicated to climate change where around head of states from the world participated and prior to this Prime Minister Imran Khan during the previous Cabinet meeting dedicated last minutes to discuss adverse environmental impacts on the country The reasons for blatant environmental degradation are our topography and geography which is the home to ecological zones from the snow covered top reaches in the North to wide deserts and sprawling coasts in the South gives ample setting for the occurrence of calamities he added The melting of Shisper Glacier is a live incident where a kilometer long glacier with kilometer thickness surging from a mountain top It is a horrible spectacle for me where it has rushed forward kilometers in months with population sitting in the middle of its course National Disaster Management Authority and district government has taken requisite measures this not what

about having excellent policy work done but no implementation on those polices he expressed However along with this policy the incumbent government has developed a three tier structure for materializing the policy approved The first thing is the Prime Minister s Committee on Climate Change comprising of four to five ministers at the federal level ensuring inter ministerial coordination headed by the Prime Minister Under this committee we have the Climate Change Council being notified with all the provinces and chief ministers on board to have inter provincial coordination also headed by the Prime Minister It is a larger committee which has not been convened yet but will be summoned soon The last tier was Climate Change Authority under the Policy has been established where

as an emergency where the country is facing its repercussions in every single season It causes unprecedented flash floods droughts in our region with direct impact on agriculture and our ability to respond climate change Around million people have been affected by drought where Pakistan is the rd water scarce country in the world she said in her welcome remarks to the caucus We have found a huge data and information deficit across the country which is typical in our country and hope that it will not persist Climate Change is purely man made environmental deterioration resulting disasters Each one of us is responsible for this and it is high time to alarm the masses particularly the youth to take lead in devising tools to overcome this calamity Rehman said Climate Change she said had caused the country US million losses in its various consequent disasters that were much more than those caused by War on Terror Leader of the House in the Senate Senator Shibli Faraz said that climate change was not a local rather international issue where the Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf government from the day one in its government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa initiated environment conservation in the form of

implications WB Country Rep said Environmental lawyer and activist Rafay Alam also delivered a comprehensive presentation to the climate change caucus and suggested the government to devise well

to transform into hub of international marine trade on cards Chairman GPA The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Chairman of Gwadar Port Authority GPA Naseer Khan Kashani said on Wednesday that Gwadar Smart Port City Master Plan was on the cards which would transform Gwadar into a hub for industrialization commercial activity and international marine trade I believe that fortunes will trickle down to the grassroots level uplifting the lives of common people equipping them with market oriented skills unleashing job opportunities increasing educational and healthcare facilities and make them available for all households he said in an interview with Global Times He said the Gwadar Port was an integral part of CPEC and Belt and Road Initiative BRI Located close to the international oil trade and sea shipping lanes at the mouth of the Persian Gulf just outside of the Strait of Hormuz it enjoyed a unique geostrategic and geoeconomic importance for all BRI countries It provides an outlet for land locked Central Asian countries western China and Afghanistan through transit trade and by providing trans shipment facilities he added About the significance of the Gwadar Smart City Master Plan he said that much awaited Gwadar Smart City Master Plan wass at final stage following strenuous planning and insightful review between the China and the Pakistan counterparts It is expected that any rational apprehension by concerned ministries and departments have been figured out and resolved he added He expressed the hope that the master plan would be unveiled next month if everything moves accordingly New maps and guidelines for the development of the smart port city had been broken into three timelines and The key focus of the master plan over the next five years is to make available the basic civic necessities of a modern city It is designed to revamp the economic development triggering socioeconomic activities at the district level and transform Gwadar into a prosperous city he added He said the project would strategize industrial and commercial plans to attract foreign investments It is likely that Gwadar will be linked with the national grid soon as required modalities have been discussed and finalized to ensure the uninterrupted supply of electricity besides initiating the Mega Watt coal based power project Emphasis on land and zoning road networks water and sewage lines and security cameras to improve command and control systems has been given priority he added The Chairman observed that the Gwadar port the starting point for CPEC was the cheapest route from China to Central Asian nations At present Chinese exports and imports were bound to travel roughly km from the Persian Gulf to China s eastern region Gwadar ensures a shorter inexpensive route for shipping oil and gas from the Middle East and minerals from Africa When asked to comment on impact of Gwadar port on modern trade he said the Gwadar port was watershed development in the materialization of BRI It was the genesis of a giant leap that China has envisioned If Gwadar works CPEC will work and if CPEC works BRI will work Kashani pointed out that currently Pakistan had two main operating international deep sea ports the Karachi Port and Port Qasim During the coming years their capacity expansion programs were unlikely to keep pace with the expected demand growth In particular the Karachi Port had significant physical limitations and would not be able to grow at the same speed as national growth demand in the coming decades These limitations result mainly from its location which is within the city of Karachi itself and has seen very rapid growth over the past years he added He said in the case of Port Qasim although having a large physical space for expansion its possible development speed was hampered by its up stream location over km from the open sea resulting in long turnaround times for visiting ships This is not a problem for cargo linked to industries located near the port but it carries cost disadvantages for cargo that have origins and destinations elsewhere Given the situation the Gwadar Port is the answer of all future demands of modern cargo handling techniques state of the art storage and high tech logistic facilities he added Expressing satisfaction with the pace of progress he said to make the Gwadar port more functional a number of projects were underway Among them the construction of the Gwadar International Airport construction of East Bay Expressway Infrastructure Development for Free Zone construction of breakwaters dredging of berthing areas and channels coal based power plant Pak China Technical and Vocational Institute potable water China Pakistan Friendship Hospital upgrades on existing bed hospitals Clean and Green Gwadar and Gwadar Smart Port City Master Plan The projects were in different stages of completion Some recently commenced and others ready to takeoff As far as completion is concerned let me be frank Internationally port development is considered very technical and strenuous job demanding long time and patience It requires high tech coastal engineering state of the art dredging techniques and modern craftsmanship he added The Chairman said that Gwadar port built on world class standard operating procedures would have to pass through phases and processes which are globally carried out in the development of any port in the world As per the master plan it will take to years to develop the port entirely Regarding criticism that the development of the Gwadar port was part of a clandestine plot for Pakistan to fall into a debt trap he said that the Gwadar port was not a debt trap that would make Pakistan incapable to repay the loan and allow China to take over national assets especially control over the port Conversely China had unleashed a bonanza of trade concessions under CPEC to help Pakistan address its economic problems He said that CPEC funds were available in the shape of government to government loans investment and grants With the Gwadar port financial facility was not a debt but rather a grant based investment Regarding security issues he said that Gwadar was home to over million people With the inception of the Gwadar port Pakistani and foreign investors had been pouring into the city and their numbers rose daily Daily life and transportation had become quite smooth Chinese as well as local manpower working on various projects feel safe in the Gwadar Port City as multi level security has been put in place he added Recently he said two big events including the ground breaking for the new International Gwadar Airport and the Gwadar Expo took place in a peaceful manner Except for the Ormara terrorist tragedy on the Makran Coastal Highway where many innocent people were killed overall security arrangements were up to the mark Such cowardly acts of violence could never dampen the spirit of development for the Gwadar port because as a nation Pakistanis stand united against the menace He said that though were actively trying to create a trust deficit between Islamabad and Beijing it was a source of satisfaction and the Pakistani government army and Chinese authorities had complete confidence with one another on safety issues About tourism he said that Gwadar was widely appreciated as a land of warm water with long sunny coast unexplored beaches mesmerizing mountains old styled boat making markets and bustling local culture GPA is taking all necessary steps to promote tourist activities in the city However everything is demand driven and tourism has its own special dynamics Unless every basic requirement is fulfilled the tourism industry will take time to leap forward he added He said that with the progress of the Gwadar port all allied industries especially real estate would gain traction Commercial activities will attract local and international people This would serve as a catalyst for the hotel recreational and food industries Once this momentum begins Gwadar will be ready for tourism opportunities in a befitting manner Kashani said the GPA was sparing no effort to improve the ecological environment to materialize the dream of shaping Gwadar as an ecologically sound city In collaboration with Chinese engineers and environmentalists green technologies would be applied to municipal development and building a better eco system The government has vowed to plant million trees to advance afforestation in five years The trees that will be planted will have better resistance against saline water To ensure common participation to make the initiative successful GPA has talked to local politicians and lawmakers to inspire everyone to join the movement Unless the public owns the project turnaround cannot be sustainable he added He said that in first week of May GPA would kick start a social mobilization drive to inspire people and it is hoped that the results will be encouraging When asked as to how GPA would change Gwadar into an oasis and improve the living standards of local people he said that the government was impressed with the Chinese vision of a green economy We will try to follow the Chinese vision to reclaim land from sand by promoting vegetative cover establishing forests controlling desertification developing severe weather resistant cultivable lands and uplifting the lives of locals through innovating husbandry pharmacology and tourism he added The Chairman said that China had done wonders by rehabilitating China s ecological system promoting China s eco civilization and green economy at the national level and boosting a global green civilization the betterment of eco environments in barren and desolate areas poverty eradication and green economy development by utilizing cutting edge technology GPA has set this model for development with Gwadar to make this happen About Saudi Arabian investment in refinery and oil complex he said that the government did not have any reservation against any foreign player investing the Gwadar port If required modalities are met with those interested in launching their businesses GPA will help facilitate the process Initially five investment companies for industrial activities in the port s free zone have lined up Three are Chinese while two are Pakistani Licenses have been issued to these companies which will indulge in the manufacturing of high density steel pipe electric motor bikes one is a fish processing plant and while two are edible oil companies he added

India s internal affairs It said Such a response from New Delhi was not unexpected India insists on its position on Kashmir no matter what the relevant stances of China Pakistan and the international community are In fact India s removal of Kashmir s special autonomous status is beyond India s internal affairs This is because Kashmir is a disputed region between India and Pakistan which is widely recognized by the international community Furthermore after revocation of its special autonomous status the custom and life styles of local residents especially Muslims will be greatly impacted India

Station brings good effects to Pakistan society Chinese scholar The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Ruichen Hong a scholar of Green BRI Centre has said that Dawood Wind Power Station not only can improve energy situation in Pakistan but also brings benefits to the Pakistani society Hong in an interview said many countries of the Belt and Road Initiative BRI were among the world s major energy producing and consuming countries Meanwhile they are mostly developing countries with the requirement to continue expanding its energy markets according to a report published by China Economic Net CEN here on Monday Power shortages have been a major constraint on the entire Pakistani economy Pakistan s power gap is between and gigawatts The electricity structure dependent on fossil fuels brings a variety of problems to the local government Hong explained in Pakistan for every increase in the use of fossil fuel the total carbon emissions would increase which had a significant negative impact on the climate and environment and was not conducive to sustainable development Dawood Wind Power Station one of Priority Energy Projects under CPEC China Pakistan Economic Corridor is located on acres of tidal flats km east of Karachi Pakistan government hopes to boost hydropower and other renewable energy sources to increase the whole energy supply and optimize the structure of electricity Hong said Sindh province is rich in wind energy reserves Its southern wind field covers an area of square kilometers The potential of wind energy development is about megawatts and the wind direction is stable the wind speed is up to meters second That means if properly developed it can meet of the national power demand Dawood Wind power project brings significant climate and social effects Hong said This project provided new jobs for residents during its construction After completed the project will generate million kilowatt hours of electricity a year which can meet Pakistani homes need and ease the country s electricity shortage At the same time compared with thermal power generation the renewable electricity produced by wind power station has no direct greenhouse gas emission while promoting sustainable development The electric power industry is an important area which affects the national energy security and economy so it is highly valued by the government In order to improve the power structure the Pakistani government has released a series of supporting policies to stimulate and regulate the renewable energy market During the construction of Dawood project business operator has made full use of support from local government On the one hand it ensures that the government has the right to speak and capable to control the power resources On the other hand it stabilizes national economic development and results in a win win situation between enterprises and the country said Hong NBBALUegih Pak Ambassador envisions a modern Gwadar Port disproves debt trap conspiracy theory The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Pakistan Ambassador to China Moin ul Haque said on Friday that investing in hydro projects is central to the Government of Pakistan s vision for sustainable growth and socioeconomic development Pakistan has a large population and major agricultural economic base and these dams are vital for better management of Pakistan s water resources Given the uncertainties posed by climate change these projects are also significant for our national security he said in an interview with Global Times on occasion of Independence Day of Pakistan On the economic side these projects would also contribute to job creation skills development and transfer of technology Their hydroelectric component would help instigate climate change efforts lower the overall cost of electricity thus enhancing Pakistan s overall economic competitiveness he added Ambassador Moin ul Haque remarked that Pakistan and China have a long history of cooperation in the hydro sector and expressed his happiness to see the Chinese friends in the vanguard for these projects as well So the benefits of the hydro projects are quite evident and debunk the so called debt trap conspiracy theories he added He said that China and Pakistan are iron brothers and all weather strategic partners and added For the last years our relationship has been carefully nurtured by the successive governments and the peoples of the two countries It has stood the test of time No schemes of our adversaries could impact this historic and close relationship Let there be no doubt about this Elaborating more about bilateral cooperation in agriculture and training on locust control he said that both countries have maintained a very strong cooperation in the field of agriculture There are a number of established bilateral cooperation mechanisms that carry out practical cooperation in various fields such as capacity building technical cooperation policy exchange and information sharing He said both sides have also signed a number of MoUs and agreements on agricultural cooperation Moreover there are growing linkages between the agricultural research institutions of the two countries as well All these measures have significantly contributed to enhancing Pakistan s food security To a question about the development of Gwadar Port he said it is a crown jewel of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC and the Belt and Road Initiative BRI It is also a major node outside China where the overland Silk Road Economic Belt and the st Century Maritime Silk Road converge Over the past two decades and especially since CPEC s advent in Gwadar has been transformed from a remote fishing town into a fully functional port with modern infrastructure A number of projects are underway to further enhance Gwadar s business environment and competitive edge as a hub of regional commerce industry and logistics These include the East Bay Expressway as well as a new international airport and power plant among others In recent months the port s operations have continued to increase steadily and it has been also cleared as an entrep t for transshipment to Afghanistan This continued development has been made possible by the consensus of both countries leaders to take Gwadar as a priority area of our cooperation address development gaps and create better lives and livelihoods for the local people Chinese enterprises and their Pakistani partners have made enormous efforts and we are encouraged to see Gwadar develop into a major regional port he added To a question about management of debt in future he said the borrowing is done by all the countries of the world to meet their economic and development needs Pakistan is no exception Pakistan s national debt should also be seen in the context of the unprecedented and unique security and economic challenges that the country had to face in the last few decades Our policymakers thus had to balance between essential security requirements and pressing socioeconomic needs he added Ambassador Moin ul Haque said fully aware of the adverse impacts of a large national debt Pakistan s government has made necessary adjustments to its fiscal and monetary policy aimed at reducing current account deficit increasing revenue generation addressing trade imbalances and encouraging investments In wake of the unprecedented health and economic challenges posed by COVID the Prime Minister of Pakistan had appealed for a global initiative on debt relief which aims to lay the ground for debt relief to the developing countries without onerous conditions Such an initiative would enhance the fiscal space available to the developing countries including Pakistan The socioeconomic dividends of CPEC and its direct impact on improving people s livelihoods would also help in reducing our reliance on domestic and external borrowing he added On bilateral cooperation in youth education and development between the two countries he remarked that for a brighter and stronger bilateral relationship in the future the younger generation has an important role to play The youth on both sides are very aware of the close relationship between our two countries and are increasingly benefiting from the strengths of each other s educational institutions and expertise he added Giving examples he said for instance around Pakistani students are studying in Chinese universities and pointed out that an increasing number of Chinese students are now enrolled in top Pakistani universities in various disciplines while many of them follow courses at the several Pakistan Study Centres as well as Urdu language departments all across China On the same lines students in Pakistan are fully utilizing the opportunities provided by the Confucius Institutes and Chinese language departments in Pakistan There are also exchange programs for youth of the both sides that include visits of youth delegations from Pakistan to China and China to Pakistan every year on alternative basis he concluded NBBALUegf Pakistan has huge potential to attract BRI investment in renewable energy sector The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times A German scholar Dr Christoph Nedopil Wang the director of the Green BRI Centre has stated that despite the decline in total Belt and Road Investment BRI investment in due to COVID Pakistan has great potential to attract BRI investment in the renewable energy sector Energy investment maintained a stable trend in the BRI investment in According to Dr Wang BRI s investment in the first half of covered all areas Energy investment accounted for of the total investment This is a continuation of the infrastructure investment focus on the Belt and Road initiative China Economic Net CEN reported on Monday In the energy sector investment renewable energy shows a strong performance The share of renewable energy in BRI energy investment has increased year by year from in and surpassed the share of fossil energy investment in Wang said Looking at BRI energy investments saw a relative increase of non fossil fuel related energy investments While in the first months of of energy investments were fossil fuel related the share dropped to The two countries with the highest energy related investments were Pakistan and Vietnam Among them billion of China s energy investment in Pakistan is all hydropower projects which are invested by Power China In an exclusive interview he said that although Pakistan has a large amount of investment in the renewable energy sector Pakistan has great potential to attract more investment under the Belt and Road initiative There is a huge need for renewable investments so far Pakistan is coal and only truly green that is wind and solar is hydropower Wang also suggested that both Pakistan and China should focus on sustainable projects that can bring returns and prepare for a better future such as renewable energy Meanwhile China will work to appropriately integrate environmental and social safeguards to improve environmental and social outcomes CPEC projects can support Pakistan dealing with its debt through bilateral and multilateral forums as well he said The Green BRI Centre is formulating policies and providing financial and economic research to accelerate the green development of BRI with a focus on green finance The Green BRI Centre is part of the International Institute of Green Finance IIGF and Central University of Finance and Economics

Indian military presence in Occupied Kashmir point of concern for China as well Chinese media The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times This week marks a year of the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir s special status by India when it repealed a set of articles from its constitution in August Ever since there has been a near total blackout of the internet and a series of curfews and lockdowns have devastated the region s economy With a bloated presence of the Indian military international organizations are worried about grave human rights violations most of which go unreported owing to the communication shutdown according to an article published by China Global Television Network CGTN on Saturday The military deployments are a point of concern for China as well Not just because they present a constant threat of instability but also because India has used troops stationed there to pose problems for China at the border near Ladakh Last month a clash between forces of the two countries left casualties on both sides Apprehension over military actions was expressed on August by China s permanent representative to the United Nations Zhang Jun while briefing on a closed door discussion by the U N Security Council He reiterated China s stance that Kashmir is a historical dispute and should be addressed peacefully Of course it is not only China that regards Kashmir as a dispute The UN Charter Security Council resolutions and agreements between India and Pakistan also consider it as such When the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on Wednesday stated that the issue should be resolved as per the provisions of the UN India responded by saying that Kashmir is its internal affair and China has no locus standi on this matter As far as China s locus standi is concerned when India lays claim on Aksai Chin in the Karakoram mountains by calling it a part of Kashmir it will invariably warrant a response from China Aksai Chin has been historically under Chinese rule as per accounts from the Qing Dynasty and multiple mentions in Western literature Attempts to tamper history mixed with hyper nationalist and expansionist ambitions of the Modi government are the reason it is being seen alienated from reality Meanwhile a factual examination reveals that the problem has never been India s internal affair When Britain decolonized the Indian subcontinent in it left the decision of Kashmir joining Pakistan or India to the local people The princely state s ruler disregarded his people s wishes and invited India to annex the territory Immediately after that India and Pakistan went to the first war with each other To break the stalemate India opted to knock the door of the UN in practically renouncing its right to call the disagreement its internal matter To this day the UN considers Kashmir a dispute and maintains that it is the people of Kashmir who have to decide whether they want to remain with India or with Pakistan The presence of UN military observers in Kashmir also invalidates the Indian argument of the dispute being its internal affair As in any other area of conflict these observers are mandated to investigate and report ceasefire violations in both sides of Kashmir Even some prominent Indian politicians are of the view that Kashmir cannot be termed India s internal matter Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary lower house leader of India s main opposition party the Congress clearly expressed this fact last year on the revocation of Kashmir s special status The party s president Rahul Gandhi went a step ahead and censured the Indian government for unilaterally tearing apart Jammu and Kashmir The unilateral nature of the move has been denounced by China as illegal and invalid By not consulting any of the stakeholders India has violated its obligations to the U N China Pakistan and the people of Kashmir After all Kashmir is not a piece of land but a matter of the future of millions of people who live there Without taking all these parties onboard any decision is a recipe for conflict China stresses that the contestation should be solved through dialogue This is quite understandable as only coming to the table will allow India and Pakistan to solve the challenges of poverty and illiteracy that plague South Asia Moreover the COVID outbreak has exposed the inadequacy of their medical systems and with India becoming the third most affected country by the pandemic it is a moment of retrospect over its priorities Instead of investing in the human capital India s pumping billions of dollars on defense imports has caused nothing but alarm in its neighborhood Last year when Pakistan shot down and captured an intruding Indian pilot the entire world was on edge over fears of escalation The episode also brought into light how fragile the situation in Jammu and Kashmir remains despite resolutions and measures undertaken by the UN China has invested heavily in its partnerships with India and Pakistan While it is the second largest trading partner of India the China Pakistan Economic Corridor forms the southern prong of the Belt and Road Initiative It is therefore logical for China to ask the two countries to sort out their differences on Kashmir and serve the common good of the international community NBBALUegy Over GB students graduate from education program under CPEC The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times As many as Pakistani students a majority of whom from Gilgit Baltistan have graduated from Suzhou Vocational University after completing three years study in China Equipped with the latest knowledge and skills in machine manufacturing and mechatronics they are expected to contribute their due part to the revitalization of Made in Pakistan China Economic Net CEN reported here on Thursday The students are beneficiaries of an education program initiated and supported by the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC Culture Communication Center which was jointly established by the government of Gilgit Baltistan and Suzhou Vocational University three years ago to promote education cooperation and cultural exchanges between Pakistan and China The scholarship and tuition fee of the students are provided by the center The main executor of the program Suzhou Vocational University is located in one of China s major manufacturing bases Suzhou from where a considerable amount of Made in China products are exported to markets throughout the world And the achievement is in part attributed to its developed vocational education system As per the plan of the program most of the students learn machine manufacturing and mechatronics at Suzhou Vocational University to meet the demand of Pakistani enterprises for skilled technicians Through theoretical and practical courses all of them have a good command of the know how to operate sophisticated machines and perform process analysis and CNC programming according to design drawings They are also offered internship opportunities at the partner companies of the university for one semester before graduation and the qualified ones can get a formal offer from the employers With all the skills I ve learned in Suzhou I now have the capability to devote to the manufacturing development of Pakistan said one of the student representatives who has won the scholarship for three consecutive years In terms of their future plan have received letters of admission from different Chinese universities for undergraduate study will finish internship and enter into the job market and the rest have planned further study in Russia Italy or other countries St Fulin Group one of the first Chinese private enterprises to enter into the Pakistani market in played a major part in launching the program CEO of St Fulin Group Li Wenyu said one of the aims of the company is to rejuvenate the manufacturing industry of Pakistan Driven by this goal they had attempted to set up plastic particles factory printing factory and building materials industry in the country However the shortage of skilled workers due to underdeveloped vocational education in Pakistan undermined the efforts of developing manufacture The elder local experienced workers are devoid of the knowledge and skills to operate the machines imported from China In this condition I realize it s a prerequisite to developing vocational training for young people to rejuvenate Pakistan s manufacturing industry said Li Wenyu Li afterward introduced Suzhou Vocational University to the educational department of GB and facilitated the two parties to launch the CPEC Culture Communication Center The center mainly carries the functions of China Pakistan cultural exchange and vocational education cooperation We will train technical personnel for Pakistan s economic development and help build the China Pakistan Economic Corridor We will also extend our experience in cultural exchanges and educational achievements to the cooperation with other countries along the Belt and Road route Niu Xuelin party secretary of the University and Cao Yumin President of the University noted The CPEC Cultural Center has held CPEC International seminar China Pakistan vocational training seminar and other conferences alike since its establishment to promote the center s capacity to provide high level vocational training for countries along the Belt and Road NBBALUegb Growing international condemnation to dissuade India from illegal acts Pakistan Ambassador to China The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Ambassador of Pakistan to China Moinul Haque Wednesday said that the growing international condemnation would dissuade India from illegal acts as the situation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir IIOJK has gone far beyond mere deep concern As we speak the military siege of the Kashmiri people by the Indian police state has been ongoing for days with no end in sight This siege includes a communications blackout closure of educational institutions bar on religious and public assembly illegal and arbitrary detention of public figures forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings of local youth he said in an interview with Global Times He said local businesses are closed and economic activity on which the people s livelihood depends has come to a grinding halt In recent times such an inhumane lockdown has no precedence India s ban on media reporting and denial of access to independent observers smacks of its nefarious designs India s flagrant disregard of international norms is shocking and simply unacceptable The continued abysmal state of human rights situation in IIOJK in this st Century raises serious questions about India s claim to be a secular tolerant and pluralistic society he added Evaluation on the importance of taking urgent steps by the international community to help address the grave situation he said the past seven decades of India s illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir is replete with brutal repression pseudo legislative shenanigans and an utter and unilateral disregard for all norms of civilized state behavior The illegal action of August kick started another wave of measures to further militarize the region terrorize the population and enforce a demographic apartheid with the ultimate objective to disenfranchise and subjugate the people of Kashmir he added Ambassador Moin ul Haque said in the immediate term it is imperative for the international community to realize that by turning a blind eye to the illegal occupation and not listening to the voice of the Kashmiri people will only engender further misery and humanitarian tragedy The persecution of Kashmiri people and minorities elsewhere in India is a direct result of the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP government s Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh RSS inspired extremist Hindutva mindset which stands exposed before the international community for its crimes against humanity As the military siege of Kashmir continues and becomes ever more apparent and increasingly well documented the world can no longer ignore it Before it becomes a blot on their conscience the international community should call for a peaceful resolution as per UN Security Council resolutions Throughout this tragic yet heroic epic of the Kashmiri people the principled position and support of the government and people of China is a rare bright spot China s articulate advocacy of resolving this dispute the oldest unfinished agenda of the UN Security Council is a clarion call for the world to look past narrow self interests The urgency and importance of the dire situation require major powers to urge India to reverse its illegal actions of August lift the siege restore their fundamental rights and honor the promises made to the Kashmiri people by the Indian leadership he added While pointing out specific data facts regarding India s consistent pattern of arbitrary arrests detentions torture corporal punishment extra judicial killings and physical and digital lockdown in occupied Kashmir he said IIOJK is no stranger to Indian atrocities where killings rape torture destruction of property are the tools of choice of the Indian occupation forces Ambassador Moin ul Haque said since past three decades around Kashmiris have been killed more than civilians illegally detained and more than houses destroyed Thousands of women have been raped and countless children orphaned For this year alone around innocent Kashmiris have been killed around cases of rape and molestation and nearly cases of destruction of houses and property have been reported In addition to that nearly civilians have been arrested The two reports published by the UN office of Human Rights have given details of these human rights violations committed with chronic impunity by the Indian Security Forces he said While commenting on Indian attempt to illegally change the demographic structure of the occupied territory and intensifying its brutalization of the Kashmiri people with extra judicial killings of Kashmiri youth in fake encounters and so called anti infiltration operations amid COVID pandemic he said despite the draconian military siege in IIOJK and almost complete communications blackout the scale and brutality of India s military repression in the territory cannot remain hidden in this day and age In the first six months of alone at least innocent Kashmiris were killed by the occupying forces The tragedy has been further compounded by the COVID pandemic Ambassador Moin ul Haque remarked it is the hallmark of totalitarian regimes to use public emergencies and crises to consolidate their hold further obfuscate the truth and justify their resort to inhuman measures India under the unholy BJP RSS combine is no different While governments over the world are focused on preserving the well being of their peoples health and livelihoods India has used the pandemic to continue its repression and hateful policies Ambassador Moin ul Haque said the new domicile law for the IIOJK seeks to systematically change the demographic structure of the occupied territory According to some estimates million Indians or percent of the total Kashmiri population could acquire the Kashmiri domicile under the new law thereby diluting the residency rights Kashmiris enjoyed for centuries he added Responding to a yet another question he said first and foremost the international community and the UN should ensure that India revokes its illegal actions taken on and after August These actions have not only impacted the status quo of the disputed region it has threatened regional peace and security Pakistan expects the international community to play the role of honest broker in the dispute and take concrete actions to ameliorate the sufferings of the Kashmiri people he added Ambassador Moin ul Haque said it is also important for the UN Security Council to ensure implementation of its numerous resolutions on the status of Jammu and Kashmir not to be swayed by India s influence which now sits on the Council assess the situation in its correct perspective and pave way for holding of free and impartial plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir To a question regarding world community role in preventing the situation from escalating further in South Asia he said as the first step the military siege of IIOJK has to end immediately Secondly the international observers including from the UN and free media and health workers must be allowed into the occupied territory to assess the humanitarian impact of last August s illegal action especially as it has been aggravated by COVID Thirdly India s nefarious efforts to alter the demographic structure of the illegally occupied territory must be stopped as these are against international humanitarian law Fourthly India should allow the UN Military Observers Group for India and Pakistan to perform its mandate unhindered so as to preserve the ceasefire along the Line of Control Finally the dangerous and one sided regional arms buildup and the accelerated accumulation of advanced weaponry by the bellicose and belligerent regime in Delhi must stop It is only serving to destabilize South Asia and the world he said Ambassador Moin ul Haque said major arm supplying countries must reconsider their policies of siding with the fascist regime Such appeasement policy could lead to devastating results of proportions seen not too long ago in the last century We must not condemn the region home to a quarter of the world s population to a vicious and never ending cycle of insecurity instability and poverty The world must open its eyes before it s too late he added Regarding a question that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres asked India to end torture use of pellet guns against children in IOJK Has Pakistan observed any Indian action yet he said Pakistan appreciates UNSG s call to India to stop the human rights abuses As the Secretary General of the UN Guterres voice is powerful with a moral authority Since long the indiscriminate use of pellet guns against innocent Kashmiris have remained a favorable instrument of state terror by the Indian forces The international human rights organizations have documented in detail how thousands of people have lost their eyesight due to this weapon We could only hope that the growing international condemnation would dissuade India s fascist religion nationalist regime from their illegal acts Nevertheless Indian leaders must be held accountable for these excesses and crimes against humanity he added On the actions of Chinese and Pakistani enterprises taking for post COVID economic recovery he said Pakistan China economic engagement has continued apace with an eye on the post pandemic situation While unprecedented in its scale the economic disruption caused by the COVID pandemic would hopefully be transient The key would be to balance between prevention and control of infection risks and orderly resumption of economic activity China s encouraging economic indicators over the past several months is a clear example of success of such an approach he added He said enterprises have a leading role to play in advancing our economic and commercial ties in the post pandemic phase As a first step both countries enterprises have exchanged information and best practices for minimizing cross infection risks through the use of appropriate social distancing measures and masks gloves and other personal protective equipment PPE Both countries airlines are continuing to resume commercial flight operations which play a major part in normal business to business interaction and the movement of people and goods Chinese enterprises have also made generous donations of PPE and epidemic prevention material and equipment to their partners and host communities and local government departments in Pakistan Enterprises in the pharmaceutical sector have also stepped up their regular interactions including the all important area of vaccine development Two of China s COVID vaccine candidates are slated to commence clinical trials with Pakistani enterprises and government departments in the near term He said even at the height of the outbreaks in China and Pakistan every effort was made to minimize the impact of disruption on normal business and commercial exchanges between the two countries As the situation normalizes with China having successfully contained outbreaks and the pandemic s trajectory consistently declining in Pakistan both sides are implementing a fast track channel for smooth BB interaction To another question he said progress on the Kohala and Azad Pattan hydropower projects is a very encouraging development and part of our joint efforts to enhance Pakistan s energy mix and water resources management It also demonstrates that CPEC as the flagship project of the visionary Belt and Road Initiative BRI is continuing to forge ahead despite efforts of our adversaries and challenges posed by the COVID pandemic Guided by the consensus and vision of our leaders CPEC has entered a new phase of development and engagement Ambassador Moin ul Haque said the focus is now on industrial development agricultural modernization socioeconomic development and livelihood improvement In mid July Prime Minister Imran Khan attended the groundbreaking of the Quaid e Azam Business Park one of several special economic zones and industrial parks being developed across all parts of Pakistan with active investment and technical support from China Together with the infrastructure development of CPEC s early harvest phase these initiatives would leverage Pakistan s traditional and competitive strengths in areas such as agriculture textiles and logistics Our youth and skilled labor force would benefit creating drivers for sustained economic growth and realizing the aspirations of our people for prosperity and stability he added On Pakistan s becoming of the newest member of the SCO Youth Council he said Pakistan joined the SCO in following the Heads of State Council summit in Nursultan Kazakhstan Throughout the long course of our engagement with the SCO we have always attached great importance to the organization s potential to contribute to regional peace and security and win win cooperation amongst member countries As home to one of the world s largest youth populations Pakistan looks forward to strengthening people to people exchanges with other countries The SCO Youth Council has an important role to play in fostering greater mutual understanding and learning between our young people providing opportunities for constructive activities and promoting a common perception of challenges and threats as well as the means to address them We will continue to participate enthusiastically and encourage interactions of our youth at this forum

strike AJK or Gilgit Baltistan to vent its anger on Pakistan over tension with China in Ladakh We should prepare for war because India s agenda is aggressive aggravating and destabilizing after Ladakh standoff We should take no chances and prepare for all sorts of aggression from India he emphasized The AJK president expressed these views while addressing a webinar on China India tension in Ladakh and its impacts on Kashmir The event was organized by Karachi Council on Foreign Relations the webinar was also addressed by Chairman Senate s Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Senator Mushahid Hussian Syed Ambassador Mustafa Kamal Qazi Chairman of the Karachi Council on Foreign Relations Ikram Sehgal and Dr Huma Baqai Sardar Masood Khan emphasized that we should be prepared for an aggressive reaction from India and pointed out that both China and Pakistan are vulnerable in this regard He said Pakistan and AJK are particularly at risk because India may use this opportunity in the coming months of August or September to displace its anger and direction of that displacement would be towards Pakistan The AJK President termed bifurcation of Ladakh from Jammu and Kashmir state and declaring it as a union territory and threats of attack on AJK GB and Aksai Chin to incorporate them into Indian union as an immediate trigger of a military clash between India and China India s expansionist approach attempts to encircle China at the behest of US and conspiracies to sabotage China s Belt and Road Initiative BRI and China Pakistan Economic Project CPEC have been the other causes of tension between the two countries he added He said that besides Pakistan and the people of Jammu and Kashmir China had serious reservations about India s unlawful actions of August October last year and April this year Besides threats by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Defense Minister Rajnath Singh and other members of the Indian cabinet construction of roads bridges and military infrastructure in Ladakh and other areas close to the Line of Actual Control fueled the fire However he maintained that China has given a firm robust and befitting response to Modi regime on both diplomatic and military fronts Sardar Masood Khan said that China took the Kashmir issue to the UN Security Council the first time after years while Pakistan with the help of China succeeded to convene three informal Security Council sessions on Kashmir Later China compelled the Indian Army moving towards Gulwan valley of Ladakh to retreat he added About the US support to India in a standoff with China the AJK president said that in spite of the desire of the US establishment President Trump did not come forward to help India due to its own internal problems Similarly India could not get the expected support from Japan and Australia About the direct impact of Ladakh standoff on Kashmir the state president said that India had been making fake claims for the last years that Kashmir is its internal matter but the Ladakh episode has once again internationalized the Kashmir issue In spite of facing defeat at the hands of China in Ladakh there will be no change in India s aggressive policy against Pakistan and Azad Kashmir and it can play mischief at any time for which we will have to remain alert and alive Hindutva or the rise of RSS is an existential threat not only for Pakistan but for all South Asian regions neighboring East Asia Central Asia and West Asia So we should be prepared for those challenges as well Khan said that if war breaks out in this region it may turn into a nuclear clash and added that after facing defeat at the hands of China in Ladakh India may carry out some aggressive action against Pakistan and India in frustration The AJK president said that in order to counter India we need to remove our internal weaknesses by improving our economy narrative building on the danger posed by the doctrine of Hindutva at national and international level

Balochistan Times The China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC continues to make strides under the framework of Belt and Road Initiative as the cooperation in hydropower project construction between China and Pakistan is deepening day by day Recently Chinese companies have successively signed contracts for two major hydropower projects worth billion and billion respectively with Pakistan Kohala and Azad Pattan that are constructed by subsidiaries of China with Three Gorges Corporation and China Gezhouba Group Corporation respectively Azad Patan Hydropower Station is located on the Jhelum River Azad Kashmir region with a total installed capacity of MW The total installed capacity of Kohala Hydropower Station will reach MW Prof Zhou Rong special commentator of China Economic Net CEN and senior fellow of Chongyang Institute of Financial Study of Renmin University said in his article Currently Pakistan is moving forward to produce clean and cheaper electricity instead of utilizing the expensive imported fuel The new projects are bringing billions of dollars of foreign investment instead of putting burden of loans on the government As per Chairman CPEC Authority Gen Asim Saleem Bajwa the willingness and confidence of China and Pakistan to jointly promote the construction of CPEC has never changed and the efforts made by both parties have never stopped The pace of the corridor project construction is gradually recovering and accelerating as a series of basic work has been completed and the preparation of CPEC phase II has been completed Hydro power generation has always been considered as a big source of clean energy Pakistan and China agreed to include the megawatts Azad Pattan hydropower project into CPEC which is to be financed via Chinese RMB not US dollars It should be stressed here when the projects completed it will benefit a large population If the two hydropower projects can be completed on schedule MW should benefit million people since MW can provide electricity for people In other words it will benefit people from Rawalpindi Gujranwala and Azad Kashmir This is also of great significance to Pakistan s poverty alleviation plan green economy plan and tree planting plan the One Trillion Trees Initiative We are very encouraged that Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan said CPEC would take Pakistan on the path of rapid progress and

project of international cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative but also a flagship project of Pakistan s economic development Regardless of the economic difficulties in Pakistan CPEC remains

situation was deteriorating as India s belligerent posture and expansionist policies were imperiling peace in the region Apart from committing egregious violations of human rights in Occupied Jammu

slowed Just last week China Pakistan and a Chinese company signed a billion deal for the construction of a megawatt hydropower project at Kohala marking the country s largest foreign investment in the power sector Moreover Chairman of the CPEC Authority in Pakistan Asim Saleem Bajwa said recently that the pace of work on CPEC projects has picked up and a great deal of ground work has also been done to launch the second phase according to an article published by Global Times on Monday As a flagship undertaking of the Belt and Road Initiative BRI the CPEC will not only allow China to showcase BRI benefits to the world but will also help Pakistan improve its infrastructure and its people s livelihoods Since the coronavirus outbreak in Pakistan the frustrations experienced during the construction of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC have received widespread attention However the exploitation of these setbacks is nothing but a distortion of the bigger picture and won t affect China s confidence in pushing forward with this large scale infrastructure plan There is no denying that the coronavirus pandemic has inflicted heavy pain on the global economy but such economic pressure only underscores the importance and urgency of the BRI projects Even those who are most critical of the CPEC cannot deny that improved infrastructure and connectivity will boost the regional economy creating many jobs for the country Finally it is entirely understandable for such a significant program to encounter some problems and it would be misguided for anyone to assume that China would drop or delay CPEC projects due to such setbacks China s confidence in the CPEC won t be affected and we believe both sides have the ability to address any problems through cooperation

Jammu Kashmir President Sardar Masood Khan has said that after grudgingly accepting the independence of Pakistan India adopted a secular doctrine This concept he said was an insincere attempt as this was nothing but Hinduism mascaraed as secularism The president made these remarks while addressing two separate web conferences organized by the Institute of Policy Studies on the topic of India Past Present and Future Perceptions of the Muslim World and by the Pakistan High Commission UK on the topic Seeking Justice for Kashmiri Victims of Sexual Violence and Physical Torture and Widows AJK Presidential secretariat told media on Saturday Speaking at the IPS Session which was attended by leading international experts from the United States Saudi Arabia Bangladesh Afghanistan and Nigeria the president said Hindu fascists romanticized an imaginary state of Akhand Baharat that they claimed to have existed before the arrival of Muslim rulers in the Sub continent This notion he said was not only unsubstantiated by history it is also counterintuitive Referring to the l secularism adopted by India the AJK president said that over the decades this glue of secularism had has come off and the real face of the India s political masters had been exposed Not long after Independence on October India began working on its imperialistic agenda and invaded the Jammu and Kashmir State Driven by its Hindu extremist policy India had carried on with this agenda over the years he added Masood Khan said that lawmakers and the leadership of BJP the RSS and their affiliates had publically declared that they would do away with Muslims from within India This he said has caught the attention of Hindu zealots from across India which had consequently impacted the larger political landscape of India This BJP RSS nexus has waged three wars in the region one against its minorities inside its own borders the second one against Kashmiris in the occupied territory of Kashmir and the third one against all its neighbouring countries Considering Pakistan as enemy number one they have threatened to wipe off Pakistan from the face of the earth by the use of nuclear weapons he informed President Masood Khan said that India s ambition of becoming a colonial and imperial power in the region had led it to using the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh for sabotaging the Belt and Road Initiative BRI It has also formed a four member alliance QUAD comprising of India USA Japan and Australia to oppose the BRI and especially the China Pakistan Economic Corridor India is the biggest barrier for progress in the region SAARC has been struggling for decades and that too because India has been standing in the way of economic integration as it wants to establish its hegemony in South Asia the president added Speaking about the situation in IOJK he said that India was practising the policy of lebensraum by reoccupying the State of Jammu and Kashmir bifurcating it and now bringing it under the direct rule of Delhi He compared the New Domicile Rules introduced in IOJK to the policy followed by Nazi Germany against the Jews based initially on economic strangulation followed by demonization and marginalization and finally physical extermination The president apprised that in IOJK political leaders had been incarcerated the youth were being killed and tortured in jails all over the occupied valley and northern India He added that Kashmiri boys had been abducted and kept in prison houses where they were being subjected to torture and brainwashing Bipin Rawat India s Chief of Defence Staff had said that these boys some as young as years old were more dangerous than a pellet firing shotgun because they raised the slogan of Azadi freedom and self determination he added The president said that members of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation OIC should start a boycott divestment and sanctions movement against India while the corporate sector of these countries should be discouraged to invest in India as they were committing human rights violations against Kashmiris and Muslims of India Start by banning the import of non halal meat and non halal into OIC countries and the formation of a Kashmir Humanitarian Fund with the help of the Islamic Development Bank and Islamic Solidarity Fund He also suggested an international civil society movement be mobilized to delegitimize Hindutva and campaign to declare RSS a terrorist organization The biggest and the most trained terrorist organization in the world is the RSS They have openly declared to target Muslims not only in South Asia but all over the world he said Appreciating the supportive role of the OIC Masood Khan appealed to the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council to raise their voice against Kashmir and call out the egregious human rights violations taking place in IOJK Speaking at the web conference hosted by Pakistan High Commission the president appealed to powerful nations to make moral and legal choices for bringing India to justice and helping dismantle this machine of torture in IOJK Silence is a crime when such torture is openly taking place in any part of the world he said He added that hindus from all over India had been given domiciles of IOJK and in the same manner in which Muslim Indians had become second class citizens Kashmiris had to run from pillar to post just to prove that they were State subjects If we don t stop this now IOJK won t be a recognisable entity like it is today million Hindus will be brought in over the coming years he said The president said that India s non permanent seat in the UN Security Council would lead to three setbacks in the council Firstly it will try to delete the agenda from the UN SC calendar secondly they will make efforts to stop us from holding informal meetings on Kashmir and thirdly they will imperil funding of the mandate of the UNMOGIP As a permanent member of the UN SC UK can stop this and create a balance in the UNSC said the President while speaking to the audience He urged the British citizenry and its civil society to lead the campaign of letter writing and awareness raising on Kashmir in the international realm He also thanked MP Steve Baker for his active and vocal role in raising his voice for the Kashmir people by authoring a letter He urged him to use his clout with Downing Street and the FCO to mobilise the UK towards Kashmir advocacy in both the British Parliament and the UN SC The web conference hosted by the Pakistan High Commission London was attended by Pakistan High Commissioner to the

threat of rising China had put the US under an imperial fatigue The Chinese have adopted a policy of a de ideological method of conducting foreign relations and the country advocates an inclusive

imbalance in relationships Dr Filippo Boni viewed current US posturing due to Trump regime agenda for election rant He also believed that even countries like India within the US alliance don t share its version while wishing to advocate their own agenda European approach is not a US centric way of defining global order Europeans are appreciative of the BRI Belt and Road Initiative to some extent

potential of horticulture The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The Business Panel of Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry FPCCI Wednesday stressed the need for exploiting the huge export potential of horticulture goods by enhancing crop yield and competitiveness of the products in the international market The country needs certified nurseries for fruit saplings to not only improve fruit yield but also clinch competitive costs for its products in the international market This could be adequately addressed through series of doable and affordable interventions said Secretary General Federal of the Business Panel while talking to group of exporters via video link and identified certified nurseries for fruit saplings as a basic requirement According to press statement issued by the Panel he said although the horticulture sector contributed about per cent to the national agriculture GDP but its volume of exports remains relatively low He particularly referred to Pakistan s horticulture goods exports to China and claimed that it holds the potential to reach billion There exists bright chances for enhancement of horticulture trade between the two countries under the One Belt and One Road Initiative BRI he added Reiterating that Pakistan could export fruits vegetables and value added products worth billion to China in the next five years he said Belt Road Initiative encompassing both roads and ports infrastructure could widen Pakistan s access to new markets He said the country s exports of these goods were estimated to clinch billion as against current million within five years He also suggested provision for quarantine facilities in the special economic zones and advised to conduct trade in Chinese Currency so as to reduce dependence on US dollar The group he said had also forwarded a proposal to the government asking to convince its Chinese counterpart to allow Pakistani agricultural products at all ports in

major dramatic disruption in the global economy and Pakistan will also face severe consequences of an economic slowdown and with this abrupt change in the economic environment China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC is even more crucial for Pakistan s development than it was prior to the advent of the epidemic early this year This was stated by CEO of Karachi Education Initiative KEI Muneer Kamal while talking to China Economic Net Muneer Kamal also the former chairman of the National Bank of Pakistan Chairman of Karachi Stock Exchange who has held leadership positions at Citibank N A Faysal Bank Union Bank and KASB Bank said Given a gloomy global economic environment in the foreseeable future it would be difficult for Pakistan to attract foreign direct investment to develop its economic infrastructure In this very challenging environment it is fortunate that large CPEC projects have and will continue to be implemented The continuation of CPEC will counter some of the negative global investment environment He said the relationship with China had been and would remain unique and special for Pakistan The importance of CPEC was magnified if we see regional dynamics and their impact on Pakistan s economy Muneer Kamal explained that Pakistan s trade and investment opportunities were limited with its immediate neighbors except for China The current environment does not allow a healthy economic interaction with India and sanctions imposed on Iran limit Pakistan s trade with the Iranian market Continued instability in Afghanistan also leaves few good economic opportunities though recent developments are encouraging for better trade in the future Fortunately for Pakistan its key neighbour China is poised to become the largest economy in the world in a few decades CPEC is a manifestation of almost six decades of extremely close relationship between China and Pakistan and the former s stunning economic growth Since CPEC is a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative BRI its success will be beneficial for both countries he added Responding to a question Muneer Kamal said one of the first signs of negative impact of Covid was on Pakistan s external account Exports and remittances had already shown signs of weakness With a total debt of billion according to State Bank of Pakistan billion debt service interest and principal was required in the next three years To meet these maturing obligations will be very challenging especially when Pakistan s foreign currency sources are already under a lot of pressure It is with this background that Prime Minister Imran Khan in April this year made a plea to the developed world particularly G for a debt relief package for countries like Pakistan China fully supported this Debt Service Suspension Initiative for affected countries and proposed to carry out specific work through bilateral consultations at the request of relevant borrowers So far the G has responded positively to provide debt relief to Pakistan and other countries China s support has been greatly appreciated by Pakistan and the two sides will discuss for a possible debt relief on bilateral basis Muneer Kamal concluded by saying that apart from the bilateral negotiations on the debt deferment or rescheduling Pakistan and China should keep a sharp focus on how to expedite CPEC projects and ensure these projects will be completed on time

NBBALUegd Gwadar port remains operational during Covid pandemic The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Gwadar Port a major project under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC is functioning well despite the Covid pandemic The comments came as some reports in Western media suggested Chinese teams are unable to return to their posts amid the pandemic which is stalling many Belt and Road Initiative BRI projects Global Times reported A large number of projects under the BRI like the one in Gwadar employ a limited number of Chinese staff and rely on local employees for most roles According to the latest head count there are two Chinese employees and Pakistani employees working at Gwadar Port The port is functioning well Chinese workers have returned to their posts having completed their day self imposed quarantine a source close to senior management at the port s operator told the Global Times The port s operations have not halted That s the nature of our business We take turns to have some holidays the source said However the source added that while there is no negative impact on its operations the port cannot remain unaffected by the impact the Covid pandemic has had on global shipping Many ships drop by Gwadar after visiting a number of other ports first and with global shipping being disrupted by the pandemic there has been quite some re routing and this has affected the port said the source Located in southwest province of Balochistan Gwadar Port began to play a new role as economical transit stop and time saving trade port for land locked Afghanistan when it shipped fertilizer in January As Pakistan entered lockdown last week the port followed relevant rules and put on hold some of the projects in the nearby Free Trade Zone Construction of a steel tube factory has been halted and a business center has been closed as precautions to stop the novel coronavirus from spreading Business development to attract foreign investors has also come to a temporary halt The port itself has been sealed off to outsiders and the number of non essential visits has been cut to a minimum However the pandemic is unlikely to have a long term impact on the port s development which is measured on a scale of years rather than months Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said in a recent interview with the Global Times that CPEC construction won t be impacted in the long run although in the short run it could face some slowdown As soon as we are over the hump of dealing with the coronavirus I think we ll be back on track Qureshi said After the temporary dip things will come back quickly And the entire region stands to benefit from the projects NBBALUegx SEZs establishment important part of CPEC enrichment extension The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The establishment of Special Economic Zones SEZs is an important part of the construction of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC and is the enrichment and extension of the CPEC development a Chinese scholar said Recently the government of Pakistan has announced the establishment of Special Economic Zones SEZs in four provinces My understanding is that to establish SEZs is to implement special economic policies and systems different from those of other regions in SEZs Cheng Xizhong Visiting Professor at Southwest University of Political Science and Law said in his article published in China Economic Net He opined that the distribution of the special economic zones in the four provinces is reasonable Half of the special economic zones are located in the Punjab province two are in the Sindh province and Balochistan province respectively and one is in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province It is not necessary that every region of a country should be promoted in an absolutely balanced way The reason why China s first established SEZ is situated in coastal areas is that these areas have the potential to absorb foreign capital advanced science technology and management experience When the most developed regions are further developed they will help develop other regions so as to put the national economy and technology on the track of rapid development He said the successful first stage of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC has created good conditions for Pakistan to establish SEZs The CPEC covers the whole country of Pakistan from north to south and all parts of Pakistan can get various benefits Now China and Pakistan are committed to the second phase construction of the CPEC While continuing to promote infrastructure construction the second stage focuses on SEZs industrial parks agricultural demonstration zones and livelihood projects The construction of the CPEC is not just to build a corridor but to drive the social and economic development of Pakistan as well Therefore the establishment of SEZs is an important part of the construction of the CPEC and is the enrichment and extension of the CPEC development he added He remarked that national conditions vary from country to country so special and brand new economic policies and systems should be determined according to the actual situation of the country with its own characteristics The overall target is to make SEZs attractive to domestic and foreign investors through the promulgation of a series of preferential policies so that they are willing to invest in the SEZs on a large scale and SEZs can kick start the economic and technological development of the nation Sharing the practice of China s SEZs he said in April Deng Xiaoping the Chief Architect of China s Reform and Opening up first proposed the establishment of special export zone In March the name of special export zone was changed to Special Economic Zone which was first implemented in South China Shenzhen City In essence SEZs is one of the main forms of free port area in the world By tariff reduction and other preferential policies and by creating a good investment environment encouraging foreign investment and introducing advanced technology and scientific management we can develop national economy and technology In SEZs we should adopt special economic policies flexible economic measures and special management systems and adhere to the development target of export oriented economy China is now one of the major investors in the world There are two advantages in China s foreign investment capital and technology In China s overseas direct investment reached billion becoming the second largest foreign investor in the world Japan the largest investor reached billion in the same year a little higher than China s At present more than Chinese investors have established overseas direct investment enterprises in countries and regions around the world There are more than overseas enterprises established in the countries and regions along the Belt and Road He said it is reported that China will invest billion in Pakistan s SEZs in the next three to five years I think this figure is very conservative The relations between China and Pakistan are so close and the mutual interests between the two countries blend so closely so I believe the amount of investment should be much higher than this How much will China invest in Pakistan in the next few years It depends on the courage of Pakistan s reform and opening up the substantial improvement of business environment in Pakistan and how flexible Pakistan s preferential policies for foreign investment will be In addition it depends on the security environment and the stability of Pakistan s political situation Since Prime Minister Imran Khan took office the government of Pakistan has announced a series of policies that are conducive to economic development and foreign investment in the country Pakistan s business environment has continuously improved so in recent years foreign businessmen are more and more willing to invest in Pakistan According to the latest media report investors from China Turkey South Korea and the UK are ready to invest billion in the SEZs NBBALUegop Pak China leadership on same page on Covid CPEC international issues The Balochistan Times

ignores the facts and is obsessed with the story it made for the CPEC according to a press release issued by the Chinese embassy here Although you can never wake up a person who is pretending to be asleep we have to make our position clear and reject the negative propaganda by the US We must not let the truth be distorted and the lies run wild Alice Wells alleged that there was no transparency in CPEC projects claiming Pakistan s debt burden was growing due to the Chinese financing She also touched on the cost escalation in railways ML upgrade project and said the Chinese companies joining

The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The second phase of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative has started with the establishment of special economic zones in various parts of the country Pakistan Ambassador to China Naghmana Alamgir Hashmi said on Saturday The second phase of CPEC has now started which is actually the establishment of special economic zones in various parts of the country she said in an interview with China Economic Net Ambassador Hashmi remarked that with the establishment of these special economic zones and the signing of agreements between the Chinese and Pakistani agricultural sectors and with increased cooperation agriculture was a field with great potential for investment and re export She said that with the China Pakistan Free Trade Agreement becoming operational the price would in any way go down because the import duties would not apply So with the establishment of these special economic zones and with the increasing number of agreements and cooperation in the agricultural sector which is a priority both with President Xi and with Prime Minister Imran Khan I think this is one area where there is a huge potential of both investments growth and then re export of those value added products to China she added Talking about the Pakistani products which have the most export potential to China she said in order to let more Chinese consumers know about Pakistani mangoes a Mango Festival was held in the Pakistan Embassy Beijing This is Pakistan s third Mango Festival held in Beijing Mango is one of Pakistan s leading export products One day we hope to see Pakistani mangoes sold in supermarkets and markets across China she added To reduce the price of Pakistani Mango in China Ambassador Hashmi said that the products of the country of origin were generally cheaper but a series of tariffs were added to the products when exporting and mangoes also needed to be treated with hot water steam sterilization or other technologies These technologies were not readily available in Pakistan increasing product prices The first thing China can do to reduce the price of Pakistani agricultural products in China is through joint ventures through the introduction of technology and working with farmers and exporters to set reasonable prices in order to meet China s requirements for imported fruits and vegetables she added Secondly Hashmi believed that with the CPEC process and the establishment of the cold chain system many products could be transported by road without air transport Due to its short shelf life mango was currently unable to be transported to China by land and fisheries and other agricultural products also needed to be transported by cold chain roads so she believed this was an area where many Chinese investors do business in Pakistan This is mutually beneficial for importers and exporters and it was also a way to introduce high quality Pakistani agricultural products to China at reasonable prices On zero tariff treatment given to types of Pakistani products after implementation of FTA Phase II Ambassador Hashmi said that some traditional export varieties of Pakistan were very popular in China For example Pakistan exports a lot of rice to China but Pakistan s most famous Basmati rice is not very popular in China She said that there was another type of rice in Pakistan that was very close to Chinese rice called IRRI a small grain of glutinous rice This type of rice could be exported to China On Pakistan s sugar export to China Ambassador Hashmi said China was importing more and more Pakistani sugar and it would be the same next year For Pakistani growers exporters and sugar makers sugar was a new product launched in the Chinese market Once the attempt was successful Pakistan would export more sugar to China in the next two years Ambassador Hashmi said Pakistan produced a lot of cotton China had a huge textile industry so Pakistan s yarn was exported to China We have a lot of gems The Chinese like Onyx Baluchistan Province in northern Pakistan is the only one producing Onyx in the world There are many gold and copper is transported from our mine to China Therefore minerals and gems in Pakistan have great market potential Ambassador Hashmi said the gem field is another area where Pakistan was looking for a Chinese joint venture In northern Pakistan there are beautiful gems everywhere But we don t have advanced technology to polish them And the Chinese know how to sculpt to make beautiful jewelry products Chinese technicians stone importers manufacturers can work with Pakistan Enterprises establish joint ventures NBBALUegw Pakistani other countries diplomats celebrated New Year at

approval of the legal procedures of both parties CPFTA Phase II has come into force on December and the tariff concession measures will be implemented from Jan He said that CPFTA Phase II is a significant measure to implement the consensus reached by both countries leaders It fully reflects China s determination to uphold the multilateral trading system given the increase in the

milestone for the economic and trade relationship of the two countries More competitive products will be exported to each other due to the reduced tariffs Take Pakistan for instance it could export

between the two countries After the implementation of CPFTA Phase II the proportion of the tax items of mutual zero tariff products between China and Pakistan will gradually increase from the previous to and the level of liberalization will increase more than double Both sides will cancel the tariffs for tariff lines next year in five years and the rest in ten years In addition the two parties will also implement a tax reduction onto other products that account for of their own respective tariff lines he added In order to accommodate Pakistan s concerns China makes special arrangements in the

the business community regarding the trade deficit with China he said that China and Pakistan are All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partners the economic and trade cooperation between the two sides is a win win situation China has no intention to pursue trade surplus with Pakistan The Pakistan s trade deficit with China is mainly caused by structural factors such as the differences in economic

measures have been implemented such as making full use of various platforms to organize trade promotion activities and enhance the Pakistani export to China inspection and quarantine cooperation on

in CPEC has made positive progress and achieved remarkable results contributing greatly to Pakistan s social and economic development The CPEC has entered a new stage of enrichment and will increasingly focus on livelihood industry agriculture etc to achieve high quality development Dr Wang said the implementation of CPFTA Phase II will undoubtedly contribute to the development of CPEC For example the contractors could get raw materials and mechanical equipment from Chine with a lower price because some of them have been included in the tariff reduction lines so the cost of the project will be reduced He said it will help to stimulate the trade and investment linkage attracting more Chinese enterprises as well as other foreign investors to invest in Pakistan so as to promote the development of export oriented industries in Pakistan and expand its exports In addition the revised CPFTA has included agricultural products such as nuts and aquatic products into tariff concession which will not only promote the export of agricultural products to China but also enhance agricultural cooperation under the umbrella of CPEC he concluded NBBALUefccy CPFTA to further bridge trade deficit by boosting Pakistani exports to China Global Times The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The second phase of the China Pakistan Free Trade Agreement FTA which took effect Sunday is expected to further bridge the trade deficit between the two countries by boosting Pakistani exports to China How to narrow the trade deficit between China and Pakistan has become a very important topic in the China Pakistan relations Global Times reported Tuesday In bilateral trade between the two countries was billion but Pakistani exports to China accounted for just billion of the total This points to an obvious need for the two countries to upgrade their FTA with the aim of reducing the trade imbalance by giving each other more preferential treatments Specifically China will implement tariff reductions or exemptions for cotton yarn leather clothing aquatic products nuts and other export goods from Pakistan under the upgraded FTA It is hoped that a significant lowering in tariff levels between the two countries will deepen trade ties by cutting the deficit thus effectively promoting the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC Agricultural cooperation is a key area in which China and Pakistan will seek cooperative efforts aimed at reducing the trade deficit Agriculture is a pillar industry of Pakistan s economic development accounting for about percent of its economy while China is now the world s largest importer of agricultural products importing about billion of agricultural goods annually At present agricultural departments from both countries have signed a number of cooperation agreements and Memorandums of Understanding in the fields of agricultural information exchange training of technical personnel processing of agricultural products and animal and plant quarantine as well as production and maintenance of agricultural machinery For instance as cotton related products account for nearly percent of Pakistan s total exports experts from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences are actively engaged in technology exchange and cooperation with Pakistani experts on how to improve the quality of cotton seeds So far the China Pakistan Cotton Biotechnology Joint Laboratory is the only agricultural project under the CPEC program Moreover data shows that Pakistan s mango exports to China jumped percent year on year to tons as of mid September Exports are further expected to reach a new high of to tons Last but not least it should be acknowledged that Pakistan s massive purchase of mechanical and electrical products from China is an important reason for the high trade deficit over the years which are mainly used for CPEC construction However given the tangible outcomes so far the significance and far reaching impact of the CPEC on the sustainable development of the Pakistani economy should never be underestimated

Prince s two day visit is expected to boost bilateral trade and economic relations with joint cooperation in third party markets and yuan denominated crude trading The visit comes as Saudi Arabia and China eye promising prospects in cooperation as they build on the achievements of previous joint committee meetings The visit is also likely to deepen integration between the Saudi Vision and China

agreement will be signed during or after the visit given the importance of bilateral oil trade Amid a global trend of de dollarization a currency swap agreement would alter the landscape of crude trade between Saudi and China and it could help boost participation of Saudi Arabia in China s yuan denominated crude futures exchange Its current involvement is not impressive Jin added China opened

global crude exchange in terms of trading volume according to media reports Saudi Arabia is very likely to take part in yuan denominated crude futures trading noted Jin About percent of Saudi Arabia s

expanding in Saudi Arabia is a challenging one Chinese companies were not recognized when they first entered the Saudi Arabia market which was monopolized mostly by companies from Europe the US Japan and South Korea Li said But Chinese companies are more efficient than their competitors Combined with slightly lower labor costs projects conducted by Chinese companies are the most cost efficient Companies from China win acceptance and approval in local markets as time goes by Li added The integration of the Vision initiative and the BRI will mean more opportunities But Chinese companies have to seize these opportunities by fully utilizing their advantages Li said China and Saudi Arabia are also carrying out cooperation in science manufacturing and nuclear energy In bilateral direct

including industry agriculture and socioeconomic projects and further develop the Gwadar Port according to a report published in Global Times on Thursday Some Middle East countries have shown an interest in investing in projects under the CPEC framework It is normal and natural for China and Pakistan to call for the accelerated development of the economic corridor and widen the scope of the project to attract more investment Both China and Pakistan have decided to widen the scope of CPEC and the two countries have signed new agreements to launch industrial agricultural and socio economic projects under this initiative The CPEC is a flagship project of the China proposed Belt and Road initiative Although the project does face some difficulties it is unlikely that China will change its supportive attitude on the CPEC China s efforts to push forward the CPEC won t be given up halfway The CPEC has created an opportunity to support economic growth in the South Asian country instead of an unbearable debt burden Debt from China makes up only a small part of Pakistan s total burden The latest developments involving the CPEC add to evidence that the two countries believe the project will bring tangible benefits amid the current economic challenges The CPEC s development may appear to slow down in the past few months sparking concern that Beijing is hesitant about further investment But it always takes time to discuss issues and details before drawing up detailed plans to launch a new stage of a project At its second stage the CPEC will play a bigger role in Pakistan s

Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Ministry of Planning and Development has rejected a news report repayment of China Pakistan Economic Corridor project debt and liabilities A statement issued by Ministry said on Wednesday that the news report is based on incorrect information and biased analysis The Ministry clarified that CPEC is a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative and to date projects are at various stages of implementation and government financial liability is only to the tune of billion US dollars comprising of low interest loans and grants in infrastructure projects spread over to years payback period The official said giving the impression of Billion dollars as liability on Pakistan is false baseless and distorted Planning Ministry also said that the power projects are being executed by Independent Power Producers and finances are mainly taken by the private companies against their own balance sheets Planning Ministry also said that CPEC is not imposing any burden with respect to loans repayment while outflows would start from the year and spread over to years Moreover CPEC projects will continue to increase in the form of private investment in Special Economic Zones which were prioritized in the recent JCC meeting NBBALUeecr Ministry of Planning clarifies news article on CPEC Debt The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Ministry of Planning Development and Reforms clarified a news article regarding China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC debt published in a section of press on December The article is based on incorrect

a flagship and most active project of Belt and Road Initiative with CPEC finances comprises of Government to Government loans Private investment and grants To date projects are progressing in various stages of implementation Government of Pakistan financial liability is only to the tune of US billion comprising of low interest loans and grants in infrastructure projects spread over to years payback period Therefore giving the impression US Billion as liability on Pakistan is false baseless and distorted The Energy projects are being executed purely under Independent Power Producers IPPs mode and finances are mainly taken by the private companies against their own balance sheets Therefore debt would be borne by the investors instead of any obligation on part of the Pakistani government The dividends of the energy sector projects are also based on profit and loss and are subject to individual company s financing policies Debt accruing is also amortized in the financial structure and is included in the project viability analysis and business plans of the private enterprise Therefore CPEC is not imposing any burden with respect to loans repayment and energy sector outflows CPEC outflows would start from the year and spread over to years The resultant benefits of these investments to the Pakistan economy would far outweigh these outflows It may be highlighted that the data on the inflow outflow is prepared in consultation with relevant stakeholders including Ministry of Finance and the same is available in public domain for discussion with relevant institutions With respect to the statistics quoted by the journalist regarding inflow of CPEC projects it is again clarified that with mutual consultation of the two Governments it has been decided to

compared to the previous generations the new type has better air defence capability as it is equipped with an improved radar and more missiles that have longer range The Type A frigate also has world class stealth capability The remarks came two days after the announcement that the construction of the most advanced frigate for Pakistan Navy has kicked off in Hudong Zhonghua Shipbuilding

weather strategic cooperative partnership Ahmad Saffee a research fellow at Institute of Strategic Studies in Pakistan told the Global Times that the replacement of British made Type frigates with Chinese made Type A frigate by Pakistan Navy shows Islamabad s commitment to modernization of its defence capabilities Pakistan has also signed an agreement with Turkey for the manufacture of corvettes and other defence equipment This modernization drive can be contextualized in regional and global spheres as Pakistan gears for a proactive role in both he said According to Saffee Pakistan s defence capabilities are to maintain strategic deterrence against its enemies especially India which poses a threat Saffee added the US used to provide Pakistan with sensitive military equipment But now since it is blaming Pakistan for its failure in Afghanistan and Iraq and has also chosen India as its blue eyed boy in the South Asian region Pakistan was left with no other option except to turn to Russia China and Turkey for buying defence equipment in the wake of India building up its arsenal He stressed that Pakistan s military collaboration with China is part of a strategic partnership which shouldn t be simply limited to CPEC or BRI With regards to defence cooperation and the military aspect there are no funds allocated or no designs expressed under CPEC long term plan Whatever defence cooperation we witness today has a history and should be viewed separately he stressed Saffee thinks the recent attention being paid to the modernization of Pakistan s defence has to do more

have got interactions all through Pakistan Cheng Xizhong a senior fellow of Chahar Institute said on Thursday Cheng who represented his country as Defence Attach in Pakistan gave a few proposals about how the construction of CPEC a flagship project of China s Belt and Road Initiative could further lead Pakistan on the road of development and stability There is need to fully understand the strategic significance of the economic corridor construction as it is a major project jointly constructed by China and Pakistan as well as a cooperative project between the two all weather friends he said in an interview He said most of the major projects under the framework of the economic corridor are electric power and transportation infrastructure The completion and operation of these projects are crucial for Pakistan s future socio economic development The electricity is the heart of the country and transportation infrastructure is the artery of the country Only with enough electricity and more developed transportation infrastructure could the development of the country be vigorous and could Pakistan maintain a high rate of economic growth he added Cheng also proposed that Pakistan should gradually build up self reliance ability and highly appreciate Prime Minister Imran Khan s emphasis on improving people s livelihood and a series of measures taken However he pointed out that the construction of the economic corridor including electric power and transportation infrastructure is the biggest livelihood project and is conducive to solving the fundamental problems of people s livelihood Cheng observed that Pakistan is facing many difficulties and there is a need to get to the root of the problems Hospitals schools and other daily livelihood problems can be solved step by step with the mobilization of the financial resources of the local government and the people The senior fellow said the strength and position of the country should be enhanced through industrialization Driven by the construction of the economic corridor Pakistan will gradually have the conditions to develop large scale industries and promote the development of modern service industries The industry in the country is underdeveloped and many daily necessities are imported in large quantities while the main export is agricultural products Therefore industrialization and modernization of the country should be gradually realized so as to continuously strengthen Pakistan s regional strength He said the strengthening of Pakistan s power position is also conducive to breaking the regional unipolar pattern establishing regional power balance and maintaining regional peace and stability The CPEC has the value of the strategic investment and firmly believed that with the construction of the corridor sooner or later Pakistan will enter the track of rapid development achieve economic rising and become an emerging market country He pointed out that recently Saudi Arabia has decided to invest in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor and some South Korean companies have also expressed their intention to invest in the corridor and hoped more countries will participate in the construction of this corridor This shows that more and more countries have realized that the CPEC has strategic investment value Therefore the Pakistani government should make

another thrust with the recently concluded visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan whose Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf PTI party inherited an international famed bubble and burst economy due to serious

of projects under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC a flagship of Chinese most economic ambitious Belt and Road initiative As the global scenario witnessed gradual shift from forming alliances driven by juggernaut of animosity bellicosity and war mongering a scar left behind on the international ties by the Cold War post Cold War eras and the New World Order the geo politics necessitated formulation of policies for economic cooperation and openness aimed at shared destiny which now permeates the world capitals The Pak China ties reflects the same pattern of warmth and closeness

of agreements and documents to further enhance cooperation in various fields to further cement long term relations He said after the change of government in Pakistan some elements wanted to see changes in China Pakistan relations and they also wished to see closure of some development projects under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC Therefore they launched a negative campaign to divert public opinion against the overall relations between China Pakistan as well as the CPEC a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative launched by President Xi Jinping for the shared

debt problem for sure but Pakistan does not have a China debt problem he told China Global Television Network CGTN at the China International Import Exhibition CIIE which is being held in Shanghai He made the comments in response to accusations that China was using debt diplomacy to expand its influence worldwide Asad Umar called the idea of the CPEC being some kind of sinister move by China to cause economic problems to Pakistan absolute nonsense He emphasized that the CPEC is an excellent example of cooperation between two countries which is a benefit to both sides Under the CPEC a pilot project of Belt and Road Initiative BRI the Pakistani government was granted Chinese loans to build billions of dollars of infrastructure projects from railways to roads CPEC has become the poster child for these Chinese debt trap allegations Asad Umar said China s debt was not more than percent of the total which was a not significant figure He said the percentage of debt to GDP of Pakistan was high but still manageable The reason why debt sustainability is a problem in Pakistan is that we don t have enough exports We are just not generating enough foreign currency inflows to be able to service the debt and that s the fundamental problem he added Speaking of solutions to this problem apart from increasing domestic savings Asad Umar also highlighted the importance of working with bilateral partners such as China to boost exports cooperation that could be enhanced under the events like the CIIE NBBALUeebi Pak China film collaboration growing after Silk Road Film Festival The

transcended all challenges of history With the launch of CPEC several economic openings with China have become available for Pakistanis As a result mandarin learning fever in Pakistan is in full swing This growing mandarin audience offers opportunities for Chinese filmmakers which can be utilized not only for enhancing ties but also for commercial purposes The same is true for Pakistani filmmakers intending to build on the vast Chinese film market Considering the historic affinity of Chinese people for Pakistan Urdu movies subtitled or dubbed in Chinese language are bound to succeed Increased revenues from China will ensure commercial growth for Pakistani filmmakers and ultimately improve production qualities A way forward is to undertake multi layered collaborations Foremost should be close coordination between cultural and film authorities of the two countries Continued interaction between Pakistan s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and China s Film Group Corporation will ensure that both are on the same page when launching joint projects and facilitating private investors Regular communication between film producers will allow them to discern new perspectives and frame products accordingly They will be able to learn from each other s proficiencies and benefit from the facilities and locations available to either counterpart Avenues for such employment include the advanced special effects expertise of Chinese post production artists and on location filming at the scenic terrain of northern Pakistan Initiatives from the private sector are important in this regard Investors and producers will have to be forthcoming if they want to improve their film content and expand their revenues As frequency of partnerships will increase so will their scope Lastly interaction between media students will add unique dimensions to their learning processes A fresh cultural outlook or an unconventional approach is always good to pick up in creative disciplines like film making They should work side by side with each other through student exchange programs as well as scholarships Cooperation between Pakistan and China in the domain of entertainment had been stagnant for some time Now that the ice has melted the technical prowess of Chinese filmmakers and ingenuity of Pakistani producers can be fully used for mutual betterment State owned and private

the question and answer session the President elaborated the following points The CPEC will have longer term benefits which would include construction of Special Economic Zones and creation of livelihoods Contrary to some misperceptions CPEC projects have created new jobs for tens of thousands of Pakistani citizens CPEC is one part of the overall economic development and as such was working as a catalyst and a force multiplier but it is not a substitute for Pakistan s overall development plans Third party participation in the project could be contemplated after the completion of the early harvest projects The completion of the CPEC projects in the long run would have a salutary impact on human rights human development social stability and efforts to counter extremism India has objected to the CPEC passing through a disputed territory Jammu and Kashmir Pakistan has been trying to bring India to the negotiation table to settle the Kashmir dispute for the past several decades but India has declined to recognise the dispute and demonstrate any urgency to resolve it Therefore Indian objections to the CPEC sound disingenuous It is highly probable that India resents Pakistan becoming prosperous and its markets becoming oriented towards East Central West and South west Asia That said Pakistan has always maintained that the CPEC would benefit South Asia and other adjoining regions and that of course would and that upon the resolution of outstanding disputes and normalization of relations among the states of the region Pakistan or other countries participating in the BRI do not fear that Chinese heavy investments would lead to the export of Chinese political model China has demonstrated over the years that it abides by the principles of respect for the sovereignty and

argued Gen Janjua said Pakistan has central role in the emerging geo economic order as it can help connect the countries economically Even India cannot trade with this part of the world without Pakistan on board he said But one Indian scholar Sudheendhra Kulkarni wondered if Pakistan s vision of connectivity projects westwards only suggesting that the eastern side be included more clearly Speakers said during different sessions that stability in South Asia is often a pre requisite for its connectivity That much is true What cannot be denied is that a more integrated region will automatically provide grounds for achieving stability and security in the region Earlier participants of the conference explored how to achieve connectivity in a region that is beset with old rivalries and instabilities Some argued that the habit of thinking everything in terms of geopolitics has to change into geo economics should the region want to gain maximum from economic initiatives

know that Pakistani and Indian diplomats have deliberated almost all issues between the two in quite detail Those deliberations now await implementation he said The conference called for long term

of the world s largest and comprehensive manufacturing industry targeting per cent areas as compared to the per cent by the United States He said the biggest change in China s foreign policy was its acceptance of globalization and mentioned that President Xi Jinping s trilogy of a new China was based on the principles of survival development and dignity besides attaining economic and military efficiency He said Xi s demand of shaping foreign policy was adopting a strategy with Chinese characteristics such as becoming a world power from a regional power and from reactive approach diplomacy to proactive diplomacy He said China believed in a community with shared future win win international relations a global partnership network and a better neighbouring diplomacy Prof Jin said China was focusing on the concept of Asian security which meant a common comprehensive and sustainable security to ensure co existence It is an Asian philosophy of sorting out an international issue in contrast

with Vietnam India and Japan He said China would keep communication open with India to invite it to join Belt and Road Initiative because infrastructure was the first step towards industrialization

The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times International and regional developments require both India and Pakistan to start negotiating for improving ties and join hands for mutual development Global Times a Chinese daily newspaper said on Thursday The upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organization SCO summit to be held in China provides a great opportunity for both countries to seek a way forward an article in the newspaper said This SCO meeting is special as both India and Pakistan will attend as members for the first time It is a good opportunity as only last month Pakistan and India had restarted a peace initiative The article said the Bajwa doctrine by the Chief of Army Staff Qamar Javed Bajwa was the first step It talks about Pakistan s desire for peaceful ties with all its neighbours including India New Delhi responded positively to Pakistan s gesture and last month the Indian delegation attended a Track II diplomacy meeting However in the past there have been several instances of Track I and Track II diplomacy efforts formal and informal channels have been used to bridge the gap between Islamabad and New Delhi Sadly bilateral ties are so fragile that even a small incident can derail the whole peace process Pakistan has been trying to mend ties with India and there have been several efforts by Islamabad to offer a hand of peace The problem lies with the policies India pursues its interests in the region New Delhi is still going by the geopolitical approach instead of letting geo economics lead relations It is not only Pakistan even smaller South Asian states are not happy with New Delhi s attitude One of the main reasons for the failure of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation is the uncooperative behaviour of the Indian leadership The organization was founded with a vision to promote cooperation and economic activity in the region However it could not produce the envisioned results The SCO s predecessor the Shanghai Five mechanism concluded a Treaty on Deepening Military Trust in Border Regions in and the Treaty on Reduction of Military Forces in Border Regions in It ensured peace between SCO member states and enhance mutual trust That was a very important step toward the formation of the SCO Pakistan and India can sign a similar agreement or at least discuss similar possibilities in order to maintain peace along the Line of Control and the international border The most important prerequisite for the development of South Asia is regional peace Kashmir and water disputes between India and Pakistan are among the issues that need to be addressed the article said Both parties can discuss these issues and seek the advice of SCO member states to resolve the crisis The SCO has been cooperating to discourage terrorism separatism and extremism India if it has reservations can raise the issue and try to learn the facts from Pakistan using the SCO platform South Asia as a region has been a victim of terrorism and they can learn from the experience of other member states Terrorism is an international issue and it is not possible for one state to singlehandedly deal with it The present SCO members make the organization largest in terms of global population and area One can imagine the opportunities being offered on such a platform Uneasy or conflicting ties between India and Pakistan would prevent them from reaping the benefits offered by other members Peaceful ties with Islamabad would provide New Delhi several opportunities such as access to the Central Asian market through Pakistan India s economy is booming but a vast majority of the country still lives below the poverty line with no access to even clean drinking water and sufficient food Both countries need to seek a people centric approach while drafting their domestic and foreign policies At a time majority of Asian countries are being connected through the Belt and Road initiative India will miss the boat if it does not tag along and soon its neighbours will surpass it in terms of economic social technological and scientific development More importantly it is high time for South Asia to rise as a region and that is possible only when Islamabad and New Delhi start negotiating peace and join hands It is desirable that in their first meeting as SCO member states Pakistan and India will take steps toward amity otherwise political issues between the two will keep delaying their progress and growth NBBALUeea Pakistan advocates dialogue peaceful means for conflict resolutions bet SCO states

attracted particular attention as a result of the participation of the leaders of India and Pakistan as full members for the first time The enlargement will certainly bring value to SCO in terms of maintaining regional peace and strengthening economic cooperation Chen Yu assistant research fellow at China Institute of Contemporary International Relations told China Global Television Network CGTN commented on Wednesday Chen pointed out that there are many benefits that can be reaped from the expansion Accepting India and Pakistan s membership will aid the SCO to gain influence in the region and even the world The SCO will be capable of contributing more to regional peace and encourage economic cooperation Pakistan for example is very influential in Afghanistan A Pakistan membership will bring great benefits such as structure and stability to Afghanistan and even central Asia The SCO creates a new platform for China to combat terrorism in central Asia through cooperation with Pakistan Chen says Apart from assistance brought by Pakistan with regards to the Afghanistan issue Chen reckons that the public in Pakistan will definitely benefit from the SCO via a more powerful economy and improved infrastructure lthough the SCO will certainly reap rewards from gaining a larger membership base there are few challenges that can also come up Chen states that the SCO proposes principles of mutual trust mutual benefit and mutual respect designed to encourage its members to deal with regional affairs by negotiation Given the long term disputes between India and Pakistan as a result of territory and religions I am afraid that their divergences will be detrimental to the principle of solving problems through negotiation Chen said Furthermore a bigger SCO may make economic cooperation among its member states more complicated Although Pakistan has always advocated the Belt and Road Initiative India still hasn t actively partaken Chen worries that India may hold back economic cooperation as an SCO member Other potential challenges for SCO members brought by the expansion is how this may potentially cause difficulties in organizational works For instance India proposes to add English as one of the official languages on the board but this may prove controversial with members questioning why it is necessary to use English as an official language in an organization that is primarily made up of none English speaking countries Chen argues Regardless of all these challenges a bigger SCO will be a better SCO in the long run Chen said NBBALUeeqj Pakistan now viewed differently hub of regional connectivity Mushahid Hussain The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times CPEC is translating into reality an amazing prophecy made by the Father of the Nation

Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times China has strongly refuted suggestions its multibillion dollar economic corridor now under construction with Pakistan has hidden military designs as well I want to make it very clear BRI Built and Road Initiative initiative and with CPEC China Pakistan Economic Corridor under it it s purely a commercial development project We don t have any kind of military or strategic design for that said Yao Jing Chinese ambassador to Islamabad He made the remarks in an exclusive interview with VOA Beijing has pledged to invest about billion in Pakistan by to develop ports highways motorways railways airports power plants and other infrastructure in the neighboring country traditionally a strong ally The Chinese have also expanded and operationalized the Pakistani deep water port of Gwadar on the Arabian Sea which is at the heart of the massive bilateral cooperation known as the China Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC The strategically located port is currently being operated by a Chinese state run company China has positioned CPEC as the flagship project of its trillion global Belt and Road Initiative or BRI championed by President Xi Jinping Within five years of finalizing and launching CPEC Jing said that early harvest projects out of the total projects under CPEC have been completed or are under construction with a total investment of around billion the largest influx of foreign investment in Pakistan s year old history The projects have already brought local jobs and effectively addressed the country s once crippling energy crisis Power plants built under the joint venture officials say will have added more than megawatts of electricity to the national grid by June leading to a surplus of power While speaking to VOA the Chinese diplomat urged the United States and India to come to the CPEC project and witness the progress on the ground for themselves saying it will enable them overcome misunderstandings vis a vis CPEC There are some kind of doubts that may be there are some things hidden in it I think that when you have an objective lens to look at this project and to come to the ground to find this progress on the ground then you may have a better understanding of what we are doing here said Jing The Chinese envoy was responding to concerns expressed in Washington and New Delhi that Beijing could try to turn Gwadar into a military port in the future to try to dominate the Indian Ocean Jing explained that a state to state defense related cooperation has for decades existed between the two allied nations and China through normal channels is determined to contribute to military and strategic ability of Pakistan We don t want to make the CPEC as such a kind of platform the ambassador emphasized However he added it is natural and understandable that the project s massive size and design has raised doubts and suspicions about its aims The skepticism about Chinese intentions stems from among other things a massive airport being built in Gwadar with a landing strip of kilometers China has given nearly million to Pakistan for the construction of the airport Basically it is for China and Pakistan to make this project a successful economic project then we can make it clear our intention here Jing said India is also opposed to CPEC because a portion of the project is located on territory that is claimed by both New Delhi and Islamabad But Pakistan and China both dismiss the objections as politically motivated CPEC aims to link the landlocked western Chinese region of Xinjiang to Gwadar allowing ships carrying China s oil imports and other goods from the Persian Gulf to use a much shorter and secure route and avoid the existing troubled route through the Strait of Malacca There are currently up to Chinese nationals working on CPEC related projects in Pakistan Ambassador Jing said that new mega projects including the establishment of Special Economic Zones across the country are ready to be launched in the next stage with particular emphasis on encouraging private engagement In the next five to seven years officials estimate CPEC will have created employment for half a million Pakistanis The country s troubled economy lately impacted by insecurity and energy crisis has grown percent in the previous financial year the fastest rate in a decade and officials forecast the expected growth in the year ending June will be six percent Pakistan s deepening cooperation with China comes as the country s diplomatic relations with the U S continue to deteriorate Washington complains that Islamabad is not doing enough to eliminate terrorist groups using the country s soil for attacks against neighboring countries including Afghanistan While U S economic assistance has significantly reduced in recent years the Trump administration also suspended military assistance to Pakistan in January and linked its restoration to decisive actions against terrorist groups Pakistan strongly rejects the allegations and says it is being scapegoated for the U S led coalition s failures in ending the war in Afghanistan China is also worried about the spread of regional terrorism in the wake of a low level Muslim separatist insurgency in its troubled Xinjiang border region But Beijing has steadfastly supported Islamabad s counterterrorism efforts and dismisses U S criticism of them China s arms exports to Pakistan have in recent years exponentially increased while exports of military hardware from the country s traditionally largest supplier the U S have reportedly declined to just million in from billion China will never leave Pakistan I shall say we have confidence in the future of Pakistan said Chinese Ambassador Jing when asked whether terrorism related concerns might also push Beijing away from Islamabad China s investment under CPEC has also encouraged hundreds of private Chinese companies and thousands of Chinese nationals to arrive in Pakistan to look for business opportunities and buy property The influx of the foreigners has raised alarms among local businesses and sparked worries that the Chinese labor force will take away local jobs Jing stressed that China and Pakistan are working together to promote mutual people to people connectivity through enhanced education and cultural linkages to improve mutual understanding Ambassador Jing says there are eight Chinese universities working to promote Pakistan s official Urdu language while Pakistan study centers are working to promote mutual understanding between the two countries There are Pakistanis seeking education in China Pakistani officials say currently about students are learning Chinese language in universities and four Confucius Institutes

Learning Chinese language key to success of CPEC The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Learning Chinese language by people in Pakistani will play a pivotal role in communication and understanding China and it will ensure the success of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative Pakistan has taken several measures to ensure smooth execution of the CPEC There are currently four Confucius Institutes in Pakistan dedicated to teaching Chinese language and culture and several thousand young Pakistani people are enrolled according to an article published by Chinese newspaper Global Times on Tuesday There are more Confucius Institutes in the pipeline and a need for many more in Pakistan to meet demand In addition to Confucius Institutes there are Confucius Classrooms The classrooms are more flexible in the way they teach language and culture Around universities in Pakistan have China Study Centers Establishing such centers in our leading universities creates awareness of China and encourages research on various aspects of China the B and R and the CPEC with courses on Sinology and Chinese language These centers are producing the human resources the CPEC requires There are more than three dozen private Chinese language institutes of various sizes and capacities in Pakistan Most are Chinese owned some are joint ventures and the rest are Pakistani owned These private institutes are even more useful as they are flexible in their class timings in courses and some of them provide doorstep services They cater to people who work and cannot afford to become full time students Sometimes these institutes offer tailor made programs for small groups or companies They also provide in house teachers for companies and teach Chinese to their employees in the workplace These language centers are actually more productive and add more value they may charge more but it suits the requirements of businesses It is a good business as well and private institutes are making good money Yet there are still only around people in Pakistan learning Chinese which is much less than current demand The estimated demand is for people who have some level of Chinese and this demand can only grow as the CPEC enters the next phase of mass industrialization Some Pakistanis have already graduated from higher education institutes

PM Khaqan s recent visit to Nepal created geopolitical waves The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi s recent visit to Nepal has created geopolitical waves Abbasi sought Nepal s support in an array of regional affairs at a time when India and the U S are trying to push it to the wall Pakistani PM s trip to Nepal appears to be dramatic and sudden but it took place at an opportune moment It coincided with the formation of the strong communist government under the CPN UML chair KP Sharma Oli Interestingly Abbasi and Oli share some sort of commonality both the prime ministers are standing up to the global and regional hegemons respectively And both see China as a reliable friend which helps their countries in the time of trouble according to an article of Ritu Raj Subedi an associate editor of The Rising Nepal published in a Chinese news website China org cn on Thursday Publicly Abbasi landed in Kathmandu to congratulate Oli on his election to the premiership after Nepal became a secular federal and republican state It is indeed a unique moment in diplomacy Nevertheless the Pakistani PM came for other serious diplomatic missions He urged his Nepali counterpart to play a constructive role in reviving the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation SAARC which has become dysfunctional owing to the rivalry between India and Pakistan Its th Summit scheduled to be held in Pakistan in was postponed after India unilaterally decided to stay out of it citing an attack at its army base in Uri of Occupied Jammu and Kashmir It has been widely perceived that SAARC has become a headache for India as it includes both of its friends and foes India is blamed for weakening SAARC by promoting sub regional forums such as the Bangladesh Bhutan India Nepal BBIN Initiative and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation BIMSTEC Against this backdrop Pakistan wants to activate SAARC so as to enhance its own diplomatic credentials and prove its mettle as a regional player Nepal is currently the chair of SAARC and positive about Pakistan s request to give momentum to the stalled SAARC process It is not helpful that bilateral tension has struck down the SAARC which holds immense potential to end poverty underdevelopment and the infrastructural deficit in the region There is another reason why India is reluctant to breathe life into the moribund SAARC Nepal and Pakistan want China to also join the cash strapped regional forum to evolve it on par with other regional organizations such as ASEAN This is indeed a distasteful proposal for India that is fearful of China s growing clout across the region Endorsed by the United Nations the BRI seeks to connect Asia Europe the Middle East and Africa with massive investment in infrastructure development Pakistan and Nepal stand to benefit from the project of the century The China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC a model BRI venture has begun to yield results in the form of job creation and infrastructure development across coastlines And Pakistani PM shared CPEC s success story while urging Oli to be proactive to take advantage from the BRI during their bilateral meetings The BRI is all about connectivity It is basically China s push towards the West and all the regional countries can connect into that The opportunities are there and we just have to capitalize on that Abbasi told a local English daily He said that the CPEC provides efficient access to the sea for all of the Central Asian countries and to western China With that connectivity comes investments in power plants highways motorways ports airports rail network etc Nepal as a signatory to the BRI is eager to roll out projects to be constructed under the BRI funding Nepal and Pakistan are not connected via geography but have been intimate friends since the establishment of their diplomatic ties in Thanks to the BRI the two nations are set to be connected through CPEC which opened new areas of cooperation connectivity trade and investment between them Meanwhile a section of the Indian media characterized it as an attempt to create an axis of Nepal Pakistan and China to corner India in the subcontinent Nepal believes in the Panchsheel five principles of peaceful coexistence and has refrained itself from any zero sum game that pits one neighbor against another In Nepali political circles the Pakistan PM s trip has however been described as diplomatic efforts to neutralize India s interventionist policy towards its small neighbor Nepal s relations with China and Pakistan carry great significance to balance India s expansionist and interventionist policy towards Nepal In this context our party sees Abbasi s visit as highly positive and meaningful for Nepal as this greatly encourages it to defend her sovereignty integrity and nationality said Communist Party of Nepal Masal in a press statement NBBALUeehl Pakistan to be middle power around after its economy takes off Analyst The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Pakistan was previously viewed as a failed state by many Western countries but according to the vision of the mid to long term China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC it will be a middle power around after its economy takes off The CPEC is creating solid conditions for Pakistan s middle country dream to become a reality by building infrastructure and energy capacities industrial parks and ports creating mutual benefits with Belt and Road Jean Monnet Chair Professor of Renmin University of China said in his article published by China Global Television CGTN on Thursday Debt imperialism The Western media has given the Belt and Road Initiative BRI a new name This label seems to have come about after more than countries and international organizations signed the Memorandum Of Understanding with the Chinese government to jointly build BRI projects but some Western companies feel they do not have enough access to BRI projects Jean Monnet said a Western TV channel recently published article titled China s global trade plan is piling huge debt on smaller nations citing data from a research paper of the Center for Development claiming that infrastructure investment under China s Belt and Road Initiative would bring debt burdens to developing countries involved He asked could these fears be correct and could the Belt and Road Initiative introduce new debt vulnerabilities in developing countries Such a question he said was just like the chicken and the egg dilemma The misgiving reminds us that we should not just think about whether the hen can be sold to pay off any debt but also think about how many eggs the hen will lay Jean Monnet recalled in the early days of its reform and opening up China borrowed from the World Bank and Asia Development Bank The West was worried about a possible debt crisis but it never happened when China s economy took off We should not take a narrow view on debt as a certain level of debt can have positive externalities and the Belt and Road Initiative is aimed at building industrial capacity rather than infrastructure only China has invested million yuan in every kilometer of its high speed railways totaling trillion yuan in its high speed railways The ensuing debt instead of skyrocketing has boosted rapid development and integration of China s economy China is sharing its successful experience with BRI countries One of the key phrases to understanding China s model is development financing Learning from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank the China Development Bank creates a model of market cultivation to deal with market failure If you want to get rich build the road if you want to get rich quickly build the motor road if you want to get rich immediately build the Internet road if you want to get rich jointly build the road connecting with China Such a slogan has encouraged many developing countries to join BRI Actually even some Chinese worry about their country s own debt by building infrastructure for the Belt and Road countries given the political instability in many of them and the uncertainty of globalization What could be possible measures to mitigate such risk The only way is to create long term economic growth in the different countries NBBALUeeg Pakistan

greater global role The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times As China plans to further open up its market and promote free global trade and investment the yuan is expected to play a greater global role China has done most of what it takes to pave the way for expanded usage of yuan globally central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan told a press conference on the sidelines of the first session of the th National People s Congress Xinhua reported Zhou estimated the drive will make further progress after China gradually makes its capital account convertible and ease other restrictions Chinese yuan s globalization journey generally started from piloting RMB settlement in cross border trade in and picked up pace in when the IMF included the yuan in the basket of currencies that make up the Special Drawing Right an alternative reserve asset to the dollar China has inked bilateral currency swap agreements with over countries and regions since late to facilitate cross border trade and investment The internationalization of the yuan had slowed down amid depreciation pressure since August when the People s Bank of China PBOC reformed the yuan s midpoint rate determination mechanism but momentum picked up in with a stronger than expected yuan Data from international financial transaction agency SWIFT showed that about percent of global payments processed in January were denominated in yuan edging up slightly from the previous month but still lower than a record high of over percent There have been signs that international institutions are warming to the Chinese currency In January Pakistan s central bank adopted the yuan as a currency for trade with China Central banks in European countries including France and Germany are including the yuan in their forex reserve mix MSCI s addition of Chinese mainland shares into its emerging market index and connect programs between stock exchanges as well as bond markets in the mainland and Hong Kong help international investors trade mainland assets Crude oil futures in Shanghai will support yuan use in commodity pricing The Belt and Road Initiative will be a powerful force pushing the yuan to global stage since it boosts cross border use of yuan according to Cao Yuanzheng chairman of BOCI Research To encourage use of yuan for cross border trade and investment via the B and R initiative the PBOC decided in January that income from investment including profits and dividends of foreign funded companies could be transferred abroad freely via a cross border yuan settlement scheme A survey by the Bank of China showed rising confidence overseas in the yuan over expectations of China s bolder opening up in its financial sector About percent of the surveyed plus overseas firms and financial institutions mulls using yuan or increasing its usage The use of yuan on digital platforms has been growing fast as Chinese mobile payment platforms like Alibaba s Alipay and Tencent s WeChat Pay keep promoting a cashless society according to a SWIFIT report The building blocks for the internationalization of the currency are generally in place and authorities plan to connect capital markets and other financial fields But it will take time as the process of capital account convertibility will be carefully measured so as to prevent financial risks from undermining the economy Zhou said The Chinese yuan s march on global markets will be a gradual process as it depends on the willingness of other countries on how much they would like to use the Chinese currency Zhou added For foreign firms it increasingly pays to use Chinese yuan Cao pointed out Using the yuan in trade and investment will make it easier and cheaper for foreign firms to do business with China while including the yuan into investment portfolios will help optimize investment structure and return The rise of the yuan will bring about a more balanced and diverse international monetary mechanism and reduce risks from over reliance on one currency and geopolitical uncertainties Cao added NBBALUeedp Pak China bilateral trade soaring after signing of Free Zone Trade Agreement CPEC Ambassador Khalid The

Military Online The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The Indian authorities should seriously consider abandoning the old Greater India idea and develop a new approach in the st century and should focus mainly on it domestic affairs India is facing intensified domestic ethnic conflicts demonstrations and other difficult issues India is also at high risk of terrorist attacks It is suggested that India should focus mainly on its domestic affairs according to an article of China Military Online Recently the South Asian island country Maldives experienced a political crisis The Indian Foreign Ministry demanded immediately that the Maldives administration must respect and observe the Supreme Court s order Analysts generally believe that the Maldives political crisis is another example of India s interference in the domestic affairs of neighbouring countries For a long time India has viewed South Asia as its sphere of influence and therefore has felt unhappy about the development of friendly relations and cooperation between its neighbours and other countries Not long ago Indian Army Chief of Staff General Bipin Rawat said that Nepal Bhutan Myanmar Bangladesh Sri Lanka and Afghanistan should stand with India and India should fully support these countries in response to China s influence Currently Bhutan s diplomatic and military affairs are led by India Indian troops are stationed in Bhutan and Bhutan must consult India on its foreign policy Even though it is in the st century India still follows the example of the British Empire and attempts to turn all of its neighbouring countries in South Asia into Indian colonies India s intervention in neighbouring countries in South Asia is not only clearly reflected through its diplomacy but also through its actions including military operations In India launched the third Indo Pakistani War In India sent troops to disperse the palace guard in Sikkim imprisoned the king and turned Sikkim into an Indian state In India sent troops to Sri Lanka to suppress the rebel Tamil Tigers a Tamil militant organization that was based in north eastern Sri Lanka In a group of anti government Maldivians assisted by armed mercenaries from Sri Lanka launched a military riot in the Maldives and India dispatched an emergency para troop force and put the situation under control In recent years the awakening of the sovereignty awareness in Asian countries clashed with India s desire for increased control In order to protect their interests some South Asian countries are trying to shake off India s control and develop all round diplomacy with China and other major powers outside the region Recently two events were considered as a serious humiliation for India in its attempt to dominate South Asia First Maldives President Abdulla Yameen signed a free trade agreement with China and announced the nation s intention to join the Belt and Road Initiative Second Nepal enabled Internet access through China s fiber optic cable and thus ended India s monopoly Moreover the Nepali government strongly supports the construction of the South Asian passageway advocated by China In terms of relations with small South Asian countries the difference between China and India is that China believes that all countries whether big or small are equal China supports all South Asian countries to maintain domestic political stability and achieve true national independence China also hopes to join hands with India to help small countries in South Asia develop their economy and raise people s living standards In fact China s foreign policy is welcomed by all the people in South Asia including the Indian people They speak highly of China s policy of non interference in the internal affairs of its neighbouring countries and believe that Chinese Indian cooperation would be conducive to safeguarding peace and stability in South Asia and would also help India achieve economic growth India on the other hand is facing intensified domestic ethnic conflicts demonstrations and other difficult issues India is also at high risk of terrorist attacks It is suggested that India should focus mainly on its domestic affairs The Indian authorities should seriously consider abandoning the old Greater India idea and develop a new approach in the st century NBBALUeefe China s navigation

his country was thinking not only in terms of infrastructure development but also in terms of trade connectivity The changes would be comprehensive For one thing it will enhance prosperity by boosting employment he added He said that the Belt and Road initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping in was a new blueprint for fostering closer trade investment and cultural ties across much of the world using a patchwork of new infrastructure diplomacy and trade deals More than countries and organizations had now signed up to the Belt and Road initiative and infrastructure projects worth more than billion US dollars were already underway Ambassador Khalid believed that over the next five years more countries would sign up and pointed out that already up to countries had confirmed their interest

The Balochistan Times While refuting a media report that China was allegedly building a military base in Pakistan a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Tuesday suggested that it was not necessary for the outside world to make too much guesses in this regard I am not aware of which you mentioned Lu Kang said while responding to a question about alleged building of a Chinese military base in Pakistan during his regular press briefing held here He said that building of China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC was an important part of the Belt and Road Initiative BRI and both China and Pakistan were also making efforts to build the CPEC which was in the common interest of people and the countries along the route So I don t think it is necessary for outside world to make too much guesses in this regard he added The spokesperson of Pakistan s Foreign Office had already rejected such a report saying that there was no proposal of building any Chinese Military base near Gawadar This is all propaganda against the development of CPEC and strengthening of relations between Pakistan and China he added NBBALUeeai New Delhi holds strong grudge against China Pakistan relations Global Times The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took office Indian leaders have been quite optimistic about the country s development prospects with the wish that India will become a force to reckon with in multi polar Asia or even the multi polar world They are especially concerned about China US cooperation wary of Beijing becoming the dominant power in Asia It is because of this that the Indian government views economic cooperation initiatives proposed by China through the lens of geopolitical competition holding that the Belt and Road initiative the China Pakistan Economic Corridor as well as the economic cooperation between China and some South Asian countries like Nepal Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have encroached on its interests New Delhi holds a strong grudge against China Pakistan relations according to an article published by Chinese newspaper Global Times on Friday At the very beginning of the Indian government announced the appointment of Vijay Gokhale India s former ambassador to China as the next foreign secretary succeeding S Jaishankar who completes his extended tenure on January The foreign secretary is the top diplomat in India equivalent to the vice minister in the foreign ministry in China Indian foreign ministers are usually political appointees thus the foreign secretary plays quite an important role in foreign affairs not only serving as the senior adviser to the prime minister but also the main official who implements foreign policy Among six former Indian foreign secretaries four were ambassadors to China and most of them spoke fluent Chinese The appointment of Gokhale who is a well known expert on China indicates that diplomatic affairs between India and China occupy an important position in New Delhi s scheme of things While working as the ambassador to China he deftly handled many bilateral issues for the Modi administration He played a key role in defusing the Doklam military standoff between India and China that lasted from June to August last year His excellent performance in Indian diplomacy and his hard line stance toward China have won him the appreciation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi which further contributed to his appointment as the foreign secretary Some Indian media outlets said that the appointment of Vijay Gokhale as foreign secretary signals a quiet but significant shift in India s approach toward China As a matter of fact the appointment of Gokhale as foreign secretary should not be taken as a significant shift For one thing India s approach toward China began to change as early as Modi came to power and Ajit Doval was appointed national security adviser and S Jaishankar the foreign secretary For another the appointment came about as a result of India s diplomatic system Diplomatic policymaking in India is done by three departments the prime minister s office the National Security Council led by an influential adviser and the Ministry of External Affairs The prime minister is the final arbiter of diplomatic policy The appointment of Gokhale demonstrates that his diplomatic skills appeal to Modi It also indicates that India will continue its hard line stance toward China except slight adjustments in keeping with international situation Since Modi took office Indian leaders have been quite optimistic about the country s development prospects with the wish that India will become a force to reckon with in multi polar Asia or even the multi polar world They are especially concerned about China US cooperation wary of Beijing becoming the dominant power in Asia It is because of this that the Indian government views economic cooperation initiatives proposed by China through the lens of geopolitical competition holding that the Belt and Road initiative the China Pakistan Economic Corridor as well as the economic cooperation between China and some South Asian countries like Nepal Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have encroached on its interests New Delhi holds a strong grudge against China Pakistan relations After the administration of US President Donald Trump put forward the idea of

been in touch with authorities in Taiwan It is hoped that Gokhale who knows well about cross Straits affairs as well as the significance of the one China policy will do a good job in dealing with India China ties and avoid the mistakes made by Indian Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj who required China to reaffirm the one India policy for India to agree to the one China policy

Pakistani exporters plan to explore new trade avenues during China Import Expo The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The China International Import Expo CIIE starting from November in Shanghai will open the country s market further to the world as many exporters including those from Pakistan plan to take advantage of this unique opportunity A look at China s market reveals that it is the world s biggest destination for agricultural products including grains cotton sugar meat and milk and Pakistan produces almost all of these in abundance according to an article published by media website Chin org cnon Monday Connecting the agro potential of Pakistan with China s opening up measures the CIIE will help in exploring new trade avenues One third of Pakistan s total agricultural export is rice Just a few years back China was the second largest buyer of Pakistan s non basmati type rice but the continuously evolving arrangements have changed the scenario Nonetheless traders and governments from both countries have recently shown a willingness to resume their high volume trade After a positive response from the Chinese side to Pakistan s request for preferential treatment during Free Trade Agreement FTA discussions it is expected that the commodity s export to China will increase Pakistan is the world s fourth largest producer of cotton and has Asia s third largest spinning capacity Several factors including higher competitiveness of products and the U S dollar s surge against the local currency boosted its textile exports to around nine percent in the last financial year Fruits also form a strong part of Pakistan s export base Most prominent among these is a citrus variant known as kinnow which hit record high export figures of tons in the season Experts believe that Pakistan has an immediate capacity of exporting to thousand tons of kinnow to China in the next three years Mangoes revered as the king of fruits in Pakistan are another of its major exports Shipping starts in the month of May but is mostly headed to Europe This year s increased queries from Chinese buyers however will lead to an expanded share in China China has been investing extensively in its partner countries agricultural sectors primarily for two reasons First augmented farm produce will help resolve their local food security issues and second they will be able to export the surplus to China One such partnership among agriculturalists of Pakistan and China has been in the production of hybrid wheat Around Chinese experts from Sinochem Group Agriculture Division China s biggest agricultural inputs company have recently visited cities in Pakistan and taught modern methods tolocal farmers China s hybrid wheat using the two line hybrid technique has been successfully harvested on a large scale in Pakistan and data from a subsequent study by Pakistan s Guard AgriculturalResearch depicts that production in central regions rose by percent Pakistan and China have also been working together on farming hybrid rice Chinese scientists made a month long visit to Pakistan last year after Pakistan requested help in introducing hybrid rice in all of its four ecological zones A training program was carried out for Pakistani researchers scientists and farmers in the production of hybrid rice with the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council PARC anticipating a high yielding harvest Another ambitious project launched by China is the Agricultural Education Science and Technology Innovation League In a ceremony held in Beijing this year the University of Sargodha became the first public sector university from Pakistan to join the initiative In addition to advancing cooperation on technical application policy dialogue and talent cultivation the league will promote agricultural research among participating countries The China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC the flagship project of the BRI will play an important role in stepping up agricultural trade between the two countries Although road connectivity exists in the form of the Karakoram Highway it is limited only to the northern areas of Pakistan With CPEC extending to the extreme southern end it will be possible to transport agricultural products to enhance bilateral trade China is modernizing Pakistan s railway network as well Several projects have been started on the ML line and are progressing fast despite Pakistan s recent elections After their completion the freight capacity will further improve the transportation of agricultural produce from Karachi to Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Xinjiang will benefit most from these connectivity projects because it serves as the first stop for goods arriving from Pakistan Furthermore the Chinese government s efforts to make the province agriculturally self sufficient will be augmented by the Pakistani imports Cooperation in agricultural research and trade forms a part of several joint ventures undertaken by China and Pakistan to provide the best products for their people It is an area which has a tremendous capacity for expansion If stakeholders from both countries put more focus in this direction profits can be assured for importers and exporters alike NBBALUeeana Growing electricity needs opening up more opportunities for FDI in Pakistan Omar The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan

sufficiency Talking to Vice Chairman of National Development and Reform Commission NDRC Lian Weiliang during a meeting Omar Ayub thanked for inviting Pakistan s delegation to attend Belt and Road Energy Ministerial Conference held in Suzhou According to a message received here he hoped that the Conference under China s visionary leadership would play a critical role in rebuilding and diversifying regional energy landscape The Minister also took opportunity to brief his interlocutor about energy priorities of the present government He underlined that just the up gradation of Pakistan s distribution system required an investment worth over five billion US dollars while the upgradation of transmission system would require an even larger size of investment The Minister also extended Lian Weiliang an invitation to visit Pakistan Pakistan has great potential to grow and its energy market will witness major expansion in coming years China would continue to complement Pakistan s efforts in reforming and expanding its energy sector Lian Weiliang underscored During the meeting Lian a Minister level official of People s Republic of China recognizing the imperatives of

port is likely to develop into Pakistan s version of Shenzhen Global Times The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The Gwadar becoming Pakistan s most important port is also a special economic zone which is expected to develop into Pakistan s version of Shenzhen Gwadar Port has opened an industrial park covering several square kilometers as the first phase of the plan with many companies eager to enter the park vice president of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences Huang Renwei said in his article published by Global Times on Thursday He said Pakistan planed to open nine industrial parks to attract foreign investment not just from Chinese companies but from companies from all over the world He is impressed by the China Pakistan highway also known as the Karakoram Highway Construction of the highway began in the s It was in recent years that China and Pakistan started the phase II project involving the extension and rebuilding of the Karakoram Highway He said the Chinese companies were doing much infrastructure construction work in Pakistan and they had invested about billion and participated in more than major projects For instance China Three Gorges Corp and China Gezhouba Group have built power stations in Pakistan to solve electricity shortages while Huawei Technologies has helped modernize the country s communications network Three Gorges employs more than local workers and Huawei employs more than Although China is helping Pakistan improve its infrastructure under the CPEC program it is very one sided to consider the Belt and Road initiative BRI as a pure infrastructure promotion plan It is worth noting that hard connectivity can t succeed without the support of soft connectivity A hard connectivity project may take five years but it may require decades to achieve real soft connectivity Despite close political ties between China and Pakistan people in the two countries have had limited contact With the progress of the CPEC projects this mutual lack of knowledge may pose problems For this reason China and Pakistan have reached an agreement on new projects which must wait until all the current projects are finished and yield economic and social benefits But this does not mean that all the CPEC related projects must be halted as a recent media report claimed Although Pakistan quickly refuted the misleading report it still aroused great concern in the international community Some Western media have smeared the BRI using hype about a so called debt trap Facts prove that the CPEC is not a debt trap for Pakistan but offers the foundation for the country s modernization It is also a driving force for taking China Pakistan relations to a higher level The billion in funding China has given to Pakistan is not aid because more than billion of that was investment It should be made clear that investment is not the same as aid Moreover aid can be divided into grants and loans with only the latter requiring repayment In this sense only a very small portion of the billion can be considered as grants while most of the capital is for pure business investment he said Once an investment project is completed it will not only generate profits it will also boost local development A single project can buoy economic development and the comprehensive benefits of economic development may far exceed the original project investment Those benefits are beyond calculation In short talk of a debt trap doesn t make sense First it confuses the two concepts of investment and aid Second it overlooks investment benefits Third it ignores the macroeconomic benefits of projects From what I learned during my research Pakistanis are not concerned about a debt trap at all They are more anxious about the unbalanced distribution of BRI projects within the country he opined According to a poll conducted by a think tank in Pakistan percent of the respondents expressed support for the CPEC The remainder did not oppose the plan but they did say that they had not seen much impact from CPEC projects They hoped there would be more such projects in their regions The CPEC is the flagship program of the BRI The success of the CPEC also represents the future success of the BRI That is why Western media are never tired of smearing the CPEC NBBALUeeaj Urgent PM China The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times M says his

NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The Western media s recent reports regarding China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC are based on incorrect information distorted facts and one sided opinions of individuals It is hereby clarified that China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC is a flagship and most active project of Belt and Road Initiative where projects of worth billion have been actualized over the past years said a statement issued by FBR here Thursday The project could not be compared with Chinese overseas investment in Sri Lanka or Malaysia as frameworks and financial modes of CPEC are altogether different in nature The CPEC finances are divided in government to government loans investment and grants Infrastructure sector is being developed through interest free or government concessional loans Gwadar Port is grant based or investment which means the Government of Pakistan does not have to pay back the invested amount for the development of the port Energy projects are being executed under Independent Power Producers IPPs mode and finances are mainly taken by the private companies from China Development Bank and China Exim Bank against their own balance sheets therefore any debt would be borne by the Chinese investors instead of any obligation on part of the Pakistani government Pakistan has opted for Chinese investment under CPEC due to the favorable financing arrangements China stepped forward to support Pakistan s development at a time when foreign investment had dried up and economic activities were being crippled by energy shortages and infrastructure gaps CPEC is not imposing any immediate burden with respect to loans repayment and energy sector outflows The CPEC s outflows would start from the year and spread over to years with a maximum in the year and The resultant benefits of these investments to the Pakistan economy would far outweigh these outflows CPEC has provided enormous opportunities for Pakistan to grow economically It is an engine for economic growth and is expected to increase Pakistan s GDP growth by percent to percent CPEC has also facilitated in overcoming crucial energy transport infrastructure and supply chain bottlenecks Under CPEC development of Gwadar would ensure strengthening of maritime sector particularly the coastal tourism and local fishery industry thereby benefiting the local communities Pakistan has repeatedly stated that it is fully committed to CPEC which enjoys complete consensus among all institutions and political forces in Pakistan It is a key to the future of Pakistan s socio

Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times China has launched cross border partnerships with several international non governmental and civic organizations to create three green economic belts in countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative including Pakistan Three belts will be created using poplar trees under a plan released by the China Green Foundation at the Belt and Road International Forum on Public Cooperation for Ecological Remediation which was held in Wuwei Gansu province the China Daily reported on Friday The belts are expected to start in Northwest China and connect countries in Central and West Asia such as Pakistan Kazakhstan Iran and Turkey Under the plan a cooperative partnership will be established to encourage more exchanges of experience in developing a green economy in different countries said Chen Shuxian chairman of the foundation Poplar trees now cover about hectares worldwide according to the foundation Most of them are located in countries involved in the BRI China holds per cent of the world s total poplar tree forests which provide important economic value to people For example the poplar forest covering an area of hectares in Hotan Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region generates annual income of million yuan million according to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration In Inner Mongolia s Ejin Banner residents developed a tourism industry themed on poplar tree forests which attracted more than million tourists from home and abroad in and which has generated billion yuan annually During the forum the

c The Balochistan Times It has been hailed as a good example of a strategic cooperative partnership between two countries to promote shared economic development Yet a recent Western media report claims the new Pakistani government has decided to re evaluate the multi billion dollar China Pakistan Economic Corridor and renegotiate its terms as it is unfairly beneficial to Chinese companies at the cost of their Pakistani counterparts The report citing interviews with Pakistani ministers and advisers may sound sensational enough But it falls short on accuracy and objectivity The professional standards the newspaper has been known for is unfortunately missing in the vanilla kind of report according to China Daily here on Thursday As a matter of fact soon after its publication the Pakistani officials who were interviewed trashed the report saying their comments had been taken out of context and intentionally distorted to suit the preconceived notion of the editorial staff The CPEC a key part of the China proposed Belt and Road Initiative as a high ranking Pakistani official said is the economic future of Pakistan and it will not compromise the country s national security or interests The economic corridor has injected much needed vitality into Pakistan s economy Of the infrastructure and energy projects under the CPEC framework nine have been completed increasing Pakistan s economic growth by to percentage points a year and creating tens of thousands of jobs for the local people True Pakistan s new government has set up a nine member committee to re evaluate the CPEC but not to renegotiate the terms but to help strengthen and expedite the construction of the corridor and provide more benefits for the people in Pakistan Ignoring these facts to the only claim the CPEC is part of China s ambitious plan to extend its geopolitical influence is at best obtuseness and at worst an evil design to drive a wedge between the two all weather friends Similar evil designs have been at work to delay or disrupt the development projects involving China in some other countries Perhaps such attempts are part of a larger game plan to malign the projects China has proposed to promote shared economic development And if that is the case there is a need for China and its partner countries including its neighbours to take Western media reports on development projects with a pinch of salt Attempts to find loopholes where none exists do not help any cause least of all the cause of shared economic development But whether the West Western media in particular will accept this fact is anybody s guess NBBALUeeer China rejects reports regarding delay in CPEC construction The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Spokesperson of the Chinese foreign ministry on

priority for the country he added Geng Shuang said the Pakistan China relationship was unbreakable and the Pakistani government s commitment to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor remained unwavering As far as I know the Pakistani side has set up a nine member committee to evaluate the China Pakistan Economic Corridor Project The purpose is to strengthen the docking with the Chinese side speed up the construction of the corridor and make the construction results better to the common people of Pakistan rather than delaying the construction of the corridor he added He said as everyone knew the China Pakistan Economic Corridor was a major economic cooperation project carried out in response to the needs of the Pakistani side The construction of the economic corridor has a good driving effect on the economic and social development of Pakistan he added The spokesman said at present there were cooperative projects under the framework of China Pakistan Economic Corridor nine of which had been completed and were under construction with a total investment of billion US dollars driving the annual economic growth of Pakistan by to percentage points and creating jobs for Pakistan These results

building and sharing In the past five years the Belt and Road Initiative has become an important international cooperation platform and an important international public product for promoting multilateralism and economic globalization At present more than countries and international organizations have signed One Belt and One Road cooperation documents with China If the Belt and Road is

from Gwadar to China s Xinjiang is on the cards The pipeline is estimated to transmit a million barrels per day with its provisional capacity As China fulfills almost percent of its oil requirements from the Middle East the pipeline will diversify its oil import routes On the other hand oil exporters of the Middle East will benefit from a cheaper and faster alternative to the existing route

We believe the B and R initiative is a model for the future development of China and the whole region It is all about connectivity and trade and it covers multiple continents It promotes development of Infrastructure to facilitate movement of people and goods among various countries It also promotes cultural exchanges and the creation of harmony among various cultures and nations The B and R can

committed to making it a role model for the rest of the world There may be challenges and difficulties but we have to overcome them and make the CPEC a success story the article said The CPEC can help Pakistan to take off economically and the fruits of its early projects are already being applauded by the people Improvements to the country s road network have made it possible for people to reach almost all parts of Pakistan This has helped transport companies and the problem of load shedding has been sharply reduced Some new motorways are also starting and are now at the planning stage The

model Under this initiative infrastructure power generation development of Gwadar Port and industrialization will take place It will boost economic activities and create jobs It is expected that around two million new jobs will be generated through CPEC till according to an article published in China Daily on Monday As at this stage most of the projects are categorized as infrastructure development It will require civil engineers mechanical electrical and other related disciplines of engineering It will also need technicians masons welders carpenters surveyors steel fixer machine operators etc In addition to technical workforce it will also need economists finance accounting management HR and interpreters of Chinese language etc Among the on going projects most of them are in the power sector either hydro power coal power nuclear power or renewable energy projects The rest of the projects are development of Gwadar port airports railway pipelines optical fiber link There will be more jobs for engineers and technicians in the future with some available to other disciplines as well Pakistan needs to introduce reforms in its educational sector where it needs to identify the requirements under CPEC and then produce requisite human resource Currently Chinese companies have created around jobs for Pakistanis but in near future the number will increase exponentially However at the initial stage Chinese companies may bring their own workforce for the time being But bringing Chinese workforce is not a viable solution for long run it may solve immediate issue for short term only As the Chinese wages are higher against one Chinese worker they can hire four local workers When they bring workforce from China additional cost of air ticket medical facilities accommodation food and other costs turn out to be economically less viable Bringing Chinese workforce may shoot up the cost of project or reduce the profit margin for investors in either case it is not desired option On the other hand China is also facing shortage of labor in its own labor market Especially in developed cities in southern part of China there exists an acute shortage of labor Due to economic growth in China the standard of life has improved and many young people are not willing to opt for labor intensive job Most of the youth is well off economically and depend on their parent s money They may not work on job below their standards Some of them may be getting more money from parents than earning by job Parents having only one child but abundance of money may also not allow them to go for job below then their prestige It is a common social issue too China may not be in a position to spare workforce for overseas projects Although Pakistani workforce is not well trained and not enough skilled etc But in the longer run there is a need to train workforce up to mark where they can be utilized efficiently We need to improve their productivity It is all possible but requires hard work and government support It might be up hill task in the beginning but once initiated it will go on and on perpetually Providing jobs to locals will create a lot of good will and improve the life standard of poverty hit areas too Under social responsibility companies may extend cooperation in training and developing required human resource If master trainers are produced locally it will help to multiply the local workforce Chinese experience of development may be replicated in Pakistan Pakistan has already institutions and basic facilities need to strengthen them and streamlining them Appropriate policies and programs may be launched to address such issues The day is not so far away when Pakistan can depend on its own domestic workforce It will bring prosperity to

Pakistani peoples have reason to believe that the China Pakistan consensus in the new era will not be disturbed by all kinds of clouds from time to time The two governments and people will march forward cooperate sincerely and look forward to helping each other to further promote China and Pakistan The construction of economic corridors has moved to a higher level US Secretary of State Pompeo recently said in an interview with the US media that any potential financial bailout provided by the International Monetary Fund to Pakistan should not be used to repay Chinese loans In fact this is not the first time that the outside world has sung Pakistan s future economic development and has taken a sideline attack on China Pakistan relations In recent times Pakistan has held general elections Some Western media have specifically made a fuss about the CPEC and some China Pakistan cooperation projects However high ranking US officials have issued official statements to the outside world on the Pakistani economic issue in such an explicit way through the media Earlier several Western media reported that the current debt problems in Pakistan were related to Chinese investment However from the perspective of scientific evidence and data analysis it is difficult to argue According to data released by the Pakistani government about percent of Pakistan s external debt comes from multilateral financial institutions and about percent of its debt comes from the Paris Club China s concessional loans account for only about percent of the total external debt and are much lower than the interest rates of commercial bank loans In addition according to a study by experts from the South Asia Research Center of Peking University Pakistan s debt to China accounted for percent of

from all walks of life who have in depth practice in China Pakistan economic cooperation have the most say People from all walks of life in China and Pakistan generally believe that the CPEC will follow the broad consensus reached by the two countries and move forward steadily to continue to benefit the two peoples Recently Yao Jing Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan met with Imam Khan Chairman of

partner bringing rich and positive possibilities for Pakistan s economic development and improvement of people s livelihood With the deepening of the construction of the CPEC it will attract more and more capital from inside and outside the country to invest in Pakistan Pakistan is also expected to realize its location potential and advantages and become the core of interconnection in South Asia In response China will continue to work with the Pakistani side to promote greater development in the future of the corridor At the level of achieving common development China and Pakistan face many common historic opportunities and major issues Achieving security and stability in South Asia strengthening regional interconnection and building a more active and constructive role in the international arena is the goal of China Pakistan to achieve common development in the future and it is also the direction for the two countries to work together in the future Since the high profile announcement and implementation of a new strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia last year the United States has continued to intervene in the affairs of South Asia by using its own political economic military strength and advantageous position and has continually and unilaterally raised unreasonable demands on the Pakistani government and people And apply heavy pressure However Pakistan has extensive experience in safeguarding peace and stability in its own country and region It has made painstaking efforts and made great sacrifices It deserves the full understanding respect and support of the international community In June Pakistan as a formal member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization participated in the Leaders Summit for the first time which indicates that Pakistan will enhance its influence and recognition on the international stage through extensive and pragmatic cooperation with other members of the SCO And Pakistan will one day truly achieve stability prosperity and prosperity and it is also a long awaited expectation of China as an all weather strategic partner Throughout the fundamentals of China Pakistan pragmatic cooperation the deep friendship between the two countries is a historical basis The all weather strategic partnership is a political guarantee The people s hearts and minds of the two countries are the emotional bonds and the China Pakistan Economic Corridor serves as the Belt and Road The flagship project of the initiative is a hard won real opportunity The achievements made in the construction of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor in the past five years are sufficient to prove its own value and positive role In the future it will continue to build infrastructure promote employment improve people s livelihood strengthen cultural exchanges enhance the internal development of the Pakistani economy and internationally We will play a role as a booster in terms of competitiveness and promote the development of a higher level and higher quality in the economic and social development of the Pakistani economy Infrastructure construction is a basic element of a country s economic growth The rapid economic growth the cultivation of industrial environment and the improvement of people s well being are rooted in a solid infrastructure network and the shortage of infrastructure is precisely the bottleneck of Pakistan s economic development In the future the infrastructure construction that will continue to be promoted under the framework of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor will greatly meet the requirements of the economy The new highway network can shorten the time between urban and rural areas and regions greatly alleviate traffic congestion in large cities and reduce logistics The future construction of Gwadar Port will highlight magnetic and cluster effects on domestic and foreign capital promote Pakistan as a regional trans shipment hub and regional economic center and improve local poverty The current situation of insufficient resources for people s livelihood the completion of wind power hydropower coal power and solar energy projects in energy cooperation has continuously supplied electricity to Pakistan providing a bright and clean new life for the general public while effectively alleviating energy shortcomings Continued improvement of power transmission and distribution links improvement of energy use rate and stability have also pointed out the direction for pragmatic cooperation between the two countries In fact infrastructure construction is a long term project that is conducive to the present and will benefit the future With the continuous revitalization and development of the Pakistani economy the dividend of infrastructure will also be released to all levels of the Palestinian society The employment problem is a shortcoming that restricts Pakistan s economic development and even social stability It is also an important problem that the new government has to solve after it took office According to data from the Pakistan Planning Commission the early harvest project of the CPEC created jobs including more than are local employment and the corridor project is expected to continue to create jobs in Pakistan in the next five to seven years The corridor boosts employment not only in terms of quantity but also in quality Through systematic vocational training Pakistan is expected to have a large scale industrial workers team in the future In addition the construction of corridors has yielded fruitful results in the fields of education health medical care etc especially in the construction of underdeveloped areas helping local people solve the most basic drinking medical and educational difficulties The two countries will continue to deepen cooperation in this field and enterprises and institutions will also assume more social responsibilities and give ordinary people the opportunity to continuously improve their living standards The developed industrial system is the symbol of the maturity of the modern economy and the vision of the rich and strong that the Pakistani people have been pursuing for generations Industrial cooperation will become the most promising field in the long term planning of the corridor With the formulation of various industrial parks under the corridor project and the introduction of relevant policies more and more enterprises especially small and medium sized enterprises from China and Pakistan have come to the market through sole proprietorship and joint ventures Industrial parks have significant clustering and radiation effects Local companies in Pakistan are expected to fundamentally enhance their strength in the manufacturing sector seek a place in the global value

manufacturing potential owing to ample availability of raw materials As the incoming government looks to revitalize Pakistan s industry on modern lines companies will eventually be looking for global

those areas In modern times the first official Pakistani delegation visited China on Jan just three months after the People s Republic of China was founded Since then our relationship has evolved into one of the most enduring in modern history Pakistan was among the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with China and it provided China with an air route leading to the rest of the world

should be arranged for objective reporting Javed Jabbar The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Former Information Minister Javed Jabbar has called upon the relevant officials to set up a hour news channel and organize local media visits to the projects being completed under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC for objective reporting and creating more awareness among the people If the local media does not know enough about the CPEC it will not be able to make objective reports which will easily lead to public misunderstanding he told a Chinese language website Huanqiu com He said the main problem at present is that the information about the CPEC has not been accurately and comprehensively conveyed to the media which has caused the Pakistani people to know very little about the project For example the Thar coalfield in south eastern Pakistan is the seventh largest coal field in the world The development of the coalfield will help to solve the serious energy shortage in Pakistan and the national energy security A Pakistan coal mine company and a Chinese company have set up a power plant there Javed Jabbar opined that most Pakistanis believe that all workers in the power plant are Chinese but this is not the case Not long ago when I visited this power plant I found that out of a total of about workers only were Chinese They were mainly technicians such as supervisors engineers or senior managers and most of them were from locals or other parts of the country After being invited to the power plant the media reporters realized that they had received misleading information In fact Pakistan and China have perfected the organization and construction of this project The power plant is very efficient and has already achieved its stated goals four months ahead of schedule He said the major political parties in Pakistan are aware that cooperation with China is beneficial to Pakistan Therefore they all want to maintain good relations with China support the Belt and Road Initiative and welcome the China Pakistan Economic Corridor project This is the consensus they have reached However these political parties compete politically and hope to win more investment projects in the CPEC to support their provinces or villages Therefore they will make some remarks For example the funds of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor project must be allocated to certain provinces or the area otherwise it will not benefit the Pakistani people he added If the local media does not know enough about the CPEC it will not be able to make objective reports which will easily lead to public misunderstanding In view of this relevant parties should release more details of the project to the Pakistani public organize local media reporters and the public to visit the project site and even set up a hour TV news channel to introduce the CPEC Find out what projects are being promoted in the CPEC He said the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC project can help Pakistan build and improve power facilities highways and promote inter connectivity between Pakistan and China While promoting industrial cooperation and industrial park development it will also bring employment to more local people For Pakistan the CPEC is undoubtedly a game changer and a key factor in changing the overall situation About of the total investment of billion U S dollars in the CPEC will enter the energy sector for the construction of fire hydro and photovoltaic power stations and the remaining will be used to build and renovate highways and railways to shorten transit time as well as improving transportation efficiency These investments are mainly carried out in accordance with the principle of marketization Only a small part of this is China s loan to Pakistan and the interest rate is relatively low The pressure on the Pakistani economy is very small and it has not increased Pakistan s debt burden as some people in the world have said Pakistan should strive to improve its efficiency and coordinate between local governments provincial governments and the federal government to facilitate the smooth implementation of the project he concluded

victim in such rabble rousing stories has reaffirmed its support for the investment project according to an article published by Global Times on Friday Although there has been much controversy those most qualified to evaluate the project are the people of Pakistan The CPEC is a flagship component of the Belt and Road B and R initiative Asad Umar who is expected to become the next finance minister of Pakistan said the incoming government has no plans to renegotiate any Chinese B and R projects that have been criticized as too expensive according to media reports Pakistani media outlets said that CPEC projects have not imposed any immediate debt burden on the government as these projects are financed through a composite funding package citing a statement issued by the Ministry of Planning The statement was a response to critics who claimed that the CPEC would create an unbearable debt burden for Pakistan The real impact of the CPEC projects on the Pakistani economy will be decided by people of the country itself not bystanders who do not understand Pakistan s actual situation Ensuring smooth progress for such a complex project would not be easy Problems such as security concerns and financial sustainability have indeed posed challenges to the CPEC but those problems are not as serious as Western media outlets claim Several years after its launch the CPEC has begun to bring tangible benefits and laid a solid foundation for economic development through infrastructure improvement The Pakistani economy is projected to be on a steady uphill path partly due to the prosperous outlook of various sectors like cement steel pharmaceuticals and electronics These conditions are likely to increase Pakistan s debt repayment ability So although the CPEC does face some difficulties China and Pakistan can find solutions through communication and coordination China s efforts to push forward the CPEC won t be given up halfway The CPEC has long been seen as symbolic of China

The Balochistan Times Once Pakistan s election winner Imran Khan forms a government there will be little time to bask in his triumph the country s next prime minister will inherit a critical economic situation and analysts say he must act fast The new leadership may be forced to seek a bailout from the International Monetary Fund IMF in the coming weeks Here are some questions and answers about Pakistan s predicament What is the problem Pakistan is on the verge of a balance of payments crisis which threatens the stability of its currency and its ability to repay debts or pay for imports Its budget deficit has grown steadily over the past five years from four percent to percent of GDP Imports have skyrocketed mainly due to rising oil prices Between July and March about percent of the country s import bill was for energy machinery and metals according to a State Bank of Pakistan report Meanwhile exports mainly textiles have increased only slightly As a result the country s foreign currency reserves have declined to about billion according to recent figures given by the caretaker government This covers less than two months of imports analysts say Meanwhile the rupee has been devalued four times since December fuelling inflation We borrowed like crazy in the last four to five years so it s time to repay But we don t have reserves former finance minister Hafeez Pasha told AFP How much does Pakistan need Pakistan has gone to the IMF repeatedly since the late s The last time was in when Islamabad got a billion loan to tackle a similar crisis Today the country needs at least billion says Zeeshan Afzal the director of Insight Securities a Karachi based consulting firm If approved it would be Pakistan s largest ever bailout But it has not yet completed repayments on its previous loan which could limit its current leeway with the Fund Islamabad is betting on a maximum of billion hoping that this will have a virtuous effect on the confidence of the markets a senior diplomat who asked to remain anonymous told AFP What is the impact on Khan Khan promised to create an Islamic welfare state on the campaign trail but the plan which would require big public spending on health and education could be stillborn if the economy tanks We will have weeks not months to act Asad Umar widely tipped to be the next finance minister told the Financial Times on Thursday All options are on the table he has tweeted telling media that the new government is considering privatising all state owned companies including the once illustrious now debt laden Pakistan International Airlines But there are fears in Pakistan that the terms of any new IMF bailout will be stricter than in thanks to the tense relationship between Islamabad and Washington one of the Fund s biggest donors The US has warned that it will be watching closely to ensure Pakistan does not use IMF money to repay debts to China which has poured billions into Pakistan for infrastructure projects under its Belt and Road Initiative Is there any other option Pakistani media have reported a recent billion loan from China and another billion from Saudi Arabia though the transactions have not been confirmed In any case Saudi funds would only be used to buy oil In the face of a trade imbalance Khan could try to reduce imports But such measures have never borne fruit in a country with porous borders and numerous smuggling networks especially for consumer goods a major import item He could also seek to improve foreign investment Khan has said his anti graft campaign and clean government will improve the country s image abroad hopefully attracting investors who have been spooked by instability and structural issues in recent years The World Bank ranked Pakistan th out of countries last year for its business climate Khan has vowed change on the home front too saying his government will dramatically boost tax revenues That is a major perennial challenge only a tiny percentage of those liable actually pay taxes in Pakistan NBBALUees Pakistan to decide on more than billion bailout in six weeks Umar The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times With Pakistan facing a serious financial crisis Asad Umar the Pakistan Tehreek i Insaf leader likely to be the next finance minister has estimated that the economy may need more than billion to overcome it with a decision on where to source the funds to be made within six weeks In an interview with Bloomberg an international news service Umar a former head of Pakistani conglomerate Engro Corp was quoted as saying Friday that Pakistan s financing gap is somewhere between billion to billion though the new government would need a bit extra so it does not live on the edge The decision needs to be taken in the next six weeks the further you go forward the more difficult the more expensive the options become Umar said in Islamabad Pakistan could turn to the International Monetary Fund friendly countries and issue diaspora bonds to bolster the country s depleting reserves he said Pakistan s deteriorating finances is a key challenge for new leader Imran Khan who is working to form a coalition government after winning the most seats in last week s election Many investors and analysts see a bailout from China or the IMF as inevitable Bloomberg said Foreign exchange reserves have slumped this year on the back of a widening current account deficit prompting the central bank to devalue the currency four times since December and hike interest rates according to the report Moody s Investors Service downgraded the nation s outlook to negative last month citing the nation s worsening finances Umar said his party has not yet spoken to any potential lenders No formal work can be started until the government is formed he said If Pakistan asks the IMF for support it would not be the first time it was pointed out The nation has gone through decades of debt blowouts and balance of payment imbalances and IMF programmes since the late s The amount of Chinese loans given to Pakistan over the last months alone comes close to the IMF s last bailout of billion Those vast debts to Beijing have prompted worries from U S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who said this week he would be watching to see if Khan s new government uses IMF funds to pay off the opaque Chinese loans Umar said he would bring more transparency to the more than billion Belt and Road infrastructure projects in Pakistan and responded to Pompeo s comments One friendly advice to the Americans we ll worry about our Chinese debt but I think they better handle their own Chinese debt first he was quoted as saying We have a serious external debt problem I m not saying we don t though we don t have a Chinese debt problem With Pakistan s finances under stress Khan may struggle to implement his plans to create an Islamic welfare state Umar said his party would not attempt to privatize Pakistan s bloated and loss making state companies such as Pakistan International Airlines Corp and Pakistan Steel Mills Umar said within the first days of the new administration the state owned firms will be shifted into a wealth fund similar to Singapor s Temasek Holdings Pvt to remove them from political interference The government will also have to take over some if not all of the national airline s billion rupee debt billion to start the carrier s turnaround he said Whatever has to be done has to be done in the next few weeks Umar said It should have been done six months back Here are some other key comments Umar made in the interview On the currency Currency alignment should be decided by the state bank based on economic fundamentals not by finance ministry based on political considerations I don t think the IMF wants free float for Pakistan it s such a thin market On taxes To make businesses more competitive with regional countries the new government plans to decrease taxes on energy supply factories and agriculture It will cover up the lost revenue by introducing a wealth tax NBBALUee CPEC can open more corridors of cooperation in region Dr Shamshahd Akhtar The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The

Initiative BRI will be a game changer for Pakistan Key infrastructure developments will help connect the country and help spread growth more equitably among the people he made these remarks while addressing as a keynote speaker at the World Peace Forum recently held at Tsinghua University He said the Belt and Road initiative offered the prospect of enlarged trade production and prosperity not only for its more than participating states but also for the entire global community This bold initiative set an example for the world on how to bring about growth and prosperity through international development cooperation We must welcome China for sharing its success with the developing world he said and added this would help global stability and touch the minds and hearts of millions of people be win win for all All countries would benefit from making the relationship with China more holistic expand to include security defense and economic growth Shaukat Aziz also a member of Board Member of BOAO Forum for Asia and on the International Advisory Panel of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank AIIB outlined three key trends in the global security order geopolitical changes which would determine the nature of human condition and the emerging security order Admiring China s emergence as the economic political military and technological power in the world he said at no time in history it had brought so many people out of poverty in such a short time He said the world s increasing acceptance of China s emergence on the world stage was expected for a number of reasons As a permanent member of the Security Council a country of its size and historical importance it was natural that China should play an increasingly active role in the world China already has economic clout and it is also transforming the economies of its neighbours President Xi s Belt and Road initiative is an ambitious initiative which will change the landscape in the region This bold initiative will allow China much more reach in the world he added China has driven the establishment and success of the AIIB focused on meritocracy and efficiency and it reflected the global landscape today not that of decades ago In the wider world of diplomacy he pointed out that China had always set an example of how to conduct world affairs It never sought to interfere in the domestic affairs f the country or use bilateral relations to pressure another power He also threw light on key global trend particularly the US decreasing role in the Middle East the current administration s trade policies global financial and economic crisis Russian role in the Middle East and its strategic partnership with China and with members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization He suggested keeping channels of communication open even with the most difficult circumstances as dialogue and diplomacy were key Expressing a need of a new security order to find a peaceful adjustment between the old and new centers of power in particular between China and the US he said that a confrontation between them would be disastrous for global peace security and prosperity Terming a multipolar world better than a unipolar world Shaukat Aziz firmly believed the emergence of new powers should not be a reason for people to fear for global stability instead it could be a source of strength for the world He said the recent historic softening in relations with North Korea was an important step in solving one of the security challenges faced by the world adding China s role in mediating in the talks between the US and North Korea was significant He opined that the global financial crisis raised questions about wider and more intensive European integration and the role of the Euro in exacerbating the debt crises in Greece and some other Southern EU members The subsequent mass migrations caused by the conflict of Syria and other turmoil and economic disruptions across the Middle East and Africa had eroded Europe s liberal values and contributed to the rise of the far right in several European countries Solutions to these issues would only be possible with good quality of governance and above all effective leadership he added He also spoke in length on Middle East conflict and its serious repercussions and said the Middle East matrix of crises had become vastly more complex There was as yet no overarching design to restore peace and stability in the region adding We must put our heads together and develop a new strategy He said in view of the world s rapidly growing population it had become essential to plan and execute programs for the inclusive and equal development of all the peoples of the world Shaukat Aziz said the global challenges could not be addressed by any one nation as they required the global cooperation of all major countries working together through effective and empowered institutions A vision for such international cooperation has been offered by President Xi Jinping in the concept of Community of Shared Destiny for all Mankind We should reaffirm or endorsement for essential international agreements such as on non proliferation counter terrorism and climate change and renew our efforts to improve the work of international organizations such as the United Nations the IMF the World Bank WTO and other agencies he added He urged the world to learn a lesson from the Chinese symbol for challenge it also means opportunity and said some of the greatest challenges we face could also be opportunities to build a better more stable world Unlocking these opportunities will not only help us on our path to a new global order it will ensure it brings us peace stability and progress for all Mankind in this new Millennium he concluded The diplomatic envoys

years ago Experts expect global funds to come pouring into Pakistan s stock markets as a result Pakistan s stock market has made history giving a thrilling lesson to global investors and

Federally Administered Tribal Areas FATA The upgrade puts Pakistan in good company Other members of MSCI s Emerging Markets Asia Index include China India Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines South Korea Taiwan and Thailand This shift will attract foreign investment into Pakistan The chief reason behind Pakistan s emerging status is China funded loans and investments made under the umbrella of CPEC with Pakistan following pattern of Argentina and Vietnam The CPEC as the flagship of China s Belt and Road project helped rapidly convert Pakistan into an Asian emerging market The settling of the balance of payments also helped Pakistan to achieve this status According to Finance Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar in his budget speech on May Pakistan would become an emerging market effective June on the basis of the performance of the Karachi Stock Market KSE which emerged as the most profitable market in Asia last year Pakistan had lost Emerging Market position in late following a period of

growth Other Asian giants like Japan South Korea Singapore Thailand and Malaysia have long resisted investing in Pakistan s markets Now the performance of the KSE has outclassed the rest of Asia and Pakistan has become an emerging market If these countries continue to ignore the Pakistani market it will clearly be for political reasons rather than market driven sentiments Japan South Korea and other East Asian investors in particular need to overhaul their basic investment strategy toward Pakistan and reap the benefits The market is offering lucrative benefits The KSE s outperformance is likely to continue given Pakistan s GDP growth falling poverty and burgeoning middle class GDP growth has hit an all time high of percent in the past decade Yes isolated terrorist incidents will continue to have small scale effects on the economic management but they will not be major impact factors Plus unlike many East Asian economies Pakistan s market is virtually free of the impact of North Korean provocations East Asian investors need to take these factors into account while investing in Pakistan as new frontiers are emerging under CPEC The prudent macro economic management and fiscal discipline of the present government over the past four years and its CPEC driven enthusiasm have led Pakistan to achieve its goal of regaining emerging market status Pakistan must continue to

therefore its doors have been kept open to all He was addressing a one day international seminar on Belt and Road Initiative CPEC and regional integration organized by The Institute of International and Cultural Affairs in Islamabad The President said India s objections to China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC are fake and disingenuous He questioned that Having occupied the territory of one part of Jammu and Kashmir now it stakes claim of sovereignty to Gilgit Baltistan and Azad Kashmir under what law He said The territory does not belong to India He asked that Is India worried because it has moved its troops to the Indian Occupied Kashmir to maintain its illegal occupation in Jammu and Kashmir Or is it concerned that the people of Gilgit Baltistan Azad Kashmir and Pakistan will become prosperous Or does its anxiety stem from the fear that Kashmir will be internationalized I would ask more internationalized than it already is Sardar Masood Khan said There is no easy way to assuage India s concerns India is not a stakeholder in Gilgit Baltistan and Azad Kashmir it never was it is known in the region as an occupier and denier of the right to self determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir He said The Belt and Road Initiative is an undertaking with no precedent its scale is massive the BRI is the most ambitious global development plan in history He told that The Belt comprises a series of land corridors linking China with Europe through Central Asia and the Middle East The road is a maritime route linking China s ports to Africa and though the Mediterranean to Europe He said One Belt One Road OBOR will increase China s political and economic power Simultaneously it would enhance economic power of its neighboring countries by preparing them for absorption of new technologies as well as tapping and unleashing the full potential of their markets This is also China s way of sharing its abundant capacities in industry with developed and developing countries I have no doubt that in the long run this initiative will also have a geopolitical impact For one according to a recent forecast China s economy will grow to trillion by he said Overtime economic collaboration at this scale will have dividends for peace and security The Belt and Road Initiative BRI as it unfolds will increase China s clout and influence globally but in the process it would also empower people of the entire globe It would be a global win win Let us also not forget that China already is influential but it has politely declined to be called G he said The phenomenal BRI would not lead to a new era of imperialism because China abhors imperialism it has never practiced it and it never will he said OBOR spurs development across several continents It builds roads railroads bridges tunnels ports airports energy plants pipelines industrial zones and tourism corridors all aimed at connecting communities and nations of three continents Asia Africa and Europe he added This is a Chinese way to create shared platforms of prosperity for nations Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called it a symphony The key words in this initiative are infrastructure and connectivity that would bind states and peoples in close relationships for pursuing economic growth The cumulative investment of this initiative is projected to be nearly trillion and China is making down payment for this ambitious mega project the President said The BRI is a counterpoise to protectionism it represents a new wave of globalization which would be irreversible a wave that would empower the poor of the world develop less developed regions and bring them into the national and international mainstream Eclipsing post World War II Marshall Plan it creates opportunities for countries which is about percent of the world population and half of its gross domestic product GDP It is also supported by new multilateral financial institutions which buttress the existing international development banks he said He highlighted that Many western nations are supporting OBOR The US also sent a representative to the recent the Belt and Road Forum and American firms see profit in the boom in the construction engineering and finance sectors associated with OBOR He said The billion CPEC is considered to be the flagship of OBOR Under this project Pakistan is building Gwadar Port a network of motorways railways energy plants solar parks and wind farms All these projects are on the drawing board they are being implemented with speed and precision Moreover early harvest projects would soon deliver dividends The CPEC is not just a corridor between China and Pakistan it connects East Asia with Central South West and Southwest Asia and extends to Africa It is thus a cross regional launching pad for economic integration Moreover CPEC is a docking port borrowing a term from space technology between the Belt and the Road that joins the land corridors and sea routes passing through the Indian Ocean he said The CPEC is a corridor not a cul de sac not a blind alley It is a crossroads that joins people and regions And Gwadar is not part of the so called String of Pearls it transcends that kind of narrow geo strategic straitjacket It is now part of a bigger Belt and Road Initiative which opens up the blocked or unused arteries of the economic geography connecting Asia Africa and Europe he said CPEC is catalysing an economic revolution in Pakistan A corridor s success depends on increased cross border connectivity and engagement among investors and business communities Pakistan is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and Economic Cooperation Organization and it is cultivating its relations with Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation CAREC the President stated Talking about Afghanistan he said Stability in Afghanistan will remain a challenge despite all well meaning efforts Too many actors working at cross purposes are involved Afghanistan can be an important plank for CPEC but until the situation improves there navigation around it is advisable The corridor needs new markets We applaud the efforts of the Government of Pakistan to reach out to Africa the Gulf broader Middle East region and Central Asia Peaceful neighbourhood will make the environment fertile for the success of CPEC Taking advantage of its central location Pakistan should also explore a corridor to West Asia through Iran Turkey and another corridor to Africa It is high time Pakistan also developed its maritime economy he said Pakistan is rightly fighting the twin menaces of terrorism and violent extremism that imperil its security and undermine its economic development Pakistan alone cannot fight these threats that have transnational character And that s why Pakistan needs alliances But alliances should not embroil it in rivalries that would spawn new enemies and hostilities It needs common platforms not new flash points he said To guarantee long term success of CPEC Pakistan should continue to invest in building its deterrent and build security sinews Pakistan and China together fight off a deliberate malicious campaign to unhinge CPEC he said He regretted that Masquerading as well wishers or concerned citizens many are distorting facts and building negative perceptions about CPEC by spreading rumours The gullible and untutored would be vulnerable to such propaganda As CPEC forges ahead such disinformation campaigns would intensify A comprehensive and sophisticated strategy is required to counter such information offensive and project the CPEC in its correct perspective We are glad to see that national political consensus around CPEC has emerged Growing cohesion is visible Citizens and government alike see themselves as owners and stakeholders of the corridor and they are he said The President stated that For leveraging CPEC for regional integration we will have to use the combined strength and ingenuity of China and Pakistan Pakistan in particular will need to develop its educational and corporate muscles first to complete the CPEC projects and then to operate them In the same context Pakistan has to work on corporate compatibility with China and competitiveness of its products and practices vis a viz other global actors Azad Jammu and Kashmir has become part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor Four projects are now formally part of CPEC The MW Karot Hydropower Project and the MW Kohala Hydropower Project are being already implemented The Mansehra Muzaffarabad Mirpur Expressway and an Industrial Zone in Mirpur will anchor AJK firmly with CPEC he said Two more projects hydropower plants at Mahal and Azad Pattan have been proposed The Kashmiri leaders of the Indian Occupied Kashmir have expressed their aspiration that IOK should become part of CPEC but India would never let them do it The aspiration is legitimate because the entire territory of Jammu and Kashmir is a natural part of Pakistan he added He stressed that We should stay focused and develop even deeper relations with China our true friend and a strategic partner of Pakistan NBBALUedrk India s

and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along and beyond ancient trade routes The initiative which embraces the spirit of peace and cooperation openness and inclusiveness mutual learning and mutual benefit has gained support from more than countries and international organizations among which more than have signed cooperation agreements with China No Matshall Plan Amid skeptics questioning China s intentions behind the initiative Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said We have no intention to designate a clear geographic bound for the Belt and Road Initiative because it is an initiative for international cooperation in its essence and should be open to all like minded countries and regions Critics have likened the Belt and Road Initiative to the politically laden post war Marshall Plan However unlike the Marshall Plan the Belt and Road Initiative will never lead China to form a military alliance and the economic cooperation it purposes will not change the current security landscape In fact the Belt and Road Initiative was proposed during the post crisis era when the world urgently needed a more open and inclusive global economy Almost nine years after the financial crisis the world economy is still struggling to recover According to a UN Conference on Trade and Development and World Bank report last year foreign direct investment around the world dropped by per cent while global trade grew by slightly more than per cent the worst performance since the crisis Meanwhile fragmented international cooperation makes it difficult to effectively integrate resources to address global challenges Against such a backdrop Xi put forward the initiative offering opportunities for cooperation and development for all The Belt and Road Initiative though initiated by China is not only about China Xi said I hope people in all countries along the Belt and Road will actually feel the benefits brought by the initiative While taking care of our own interests we will give more consideration and care to the interests of other countries the Chinese president said The Belt and Road Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping shows that he attaches great importance to cooperation between Europe and Asia former French Prime Minister Jean Pierre Raffarin told Chinese newspaper People s Daily It will inject vitality into global development and shows his global vision Raffarin said the initiative is a creative one which shows China has the capability to create a new era for global development China s proposals from the Belt and Road Initiative to the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank AIIB from the setup of a billion U S dollar China UN peace and development fund to a peacekeeping standby force of troops shows the giant is assuming responsibilities as a major country said Raffarin Win Win For All Three years on since the Belt and Road Initiative was launched China and countries along the ancient trade routes are witnessing positive results in infrastructure connectivity production capacity trade investment and finance Remarkable progress has been made in the construction of land and maritime routes For instance construction is underway for phase II of the Karakorum Highway connecting China and Pakistan the Multan Sukkur section of the Lahore Karachi highway in Pakistan the China Laos railway and the Yakarta Bandung high speed railway in Indonesia Furthermore the port city in Sri Lanka s capital of Colombo is starting to take shape while Chinese shipping giant China COSCO Shipping took over the management of the Piraeus Port Authority last year Regarding production capacity China is cooperating with nearly countries with important projects confirmed with a total investment value of billion US dollars Just last year trade between China and countries along the Belt and Road hit trillion yuan billion dollars China s direct investment in those countries exceeds billion dollars There is also financial support to ensure Belt and Road projects see the light of day The China initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank now has members The first projects under the billion dollar Silk Road Fund have begun with a value of billion dollars Amid uncertainties in the world economy Belt and Road cooperation is key to kickstarting global growth What is the most attractive in the Belt and Road Initiative is that it not only spurs China s development but also benefits other participating countries said Spanish Ambassador to China Manuel Valencia Where Cultures Meet The ancient Silk Road was where Chinese civilization met with Indian Arab and European cultures Today the Belt and Road Initiative seeks to once again bring East and West closer The ancient silk roads are not just routes of trade but routes of friendship Xi said By the end of China signed more than cultural agreements with countries along the Belt and Road and set up centers on Chinese culture in those countries Meanwhile people to people ties related to the initiative such as international art festivals fairs and forums are in full swing The Chinese government also set up the Silk Road Scholarship to annually sponsor students in countries along the Belt and Road to study in China The initiative of the Belt and Road is not just economic said Nassir Abdulaziz Al Nasser high representative for the

fierce competition to win clients Zhang told the Global Times in an interview in Shanghai But she noted that such popularity does not apply to all B and R markets In Africa for example it is sometimes difficult for Chinese companies to find banks that are willing to give financial support to their expansion At this point financing for the B and R initiative is mostly via the Chinese government and related Chinese financial institutions Zhang noted However an initiative as ambitious as this requires collaborative efforts as Chinese financial institutions alone will not be able to fill the financing gap Commitments from other countries and the private sector are necessary The Standard Chartered Bank in was involved in more than B and R related projects in different ways including financing and risk mitigation according to Marrs Marrs also told that when she traveled to some of the B and R markets the business leaders she talked to all said that B and R investment is a once in a century opportunity Some of them told me that B and R is not only about importing Chinese money but also about importing Chinese infrastructure capabilities They don t believe they can do these things infrastructure construction without help from China Marrs noted Zhang said that based on the B and R projects that Standard Chartered Bank has been engaged in they haven t seen any major issues at this point Those projects are proceeding quite well currently but they will last many years say over years for many projects It s easy to get the first bucket of gold but we should also pay attention to risks that will arise later Risk management is a long term task Zhang said According to Zhang risks related to B and R projects include foreign currency risks operational risks especially due to lack of understanding of the operating countries as well as increasing geopolitical risks with the rising level of protectionism China s trade with B and R countries and regions reached trillion yuan billion in up percent year on year news website people com cn reported in February NBBALUedbap CPEC provides opportunities to SCO members to boost energy export trade potential Pak Envoy

start implementation There may be challenges but there are also opportunities like never before he added While it is imperative for the governments of member countries to facilitate trade and

states in South Asia security matrix Dastgir The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Minister for Defence Engr Khurram Dastgir said on Wednesday that in the South Asia security matrix there was no room for the self proclaimed and artificially boosted states He was addressing at the concluding session of the two day National Conference Changing Security Situation in South Asia and Development of CPEC organised by Islamabad Policy Research Institute and the Hanns Seidel Foundation here at a local hotel The minister said that the recently announced US policy on South Asia underscored a greater role for India in Afghanistan and the region while not acknowledging the exponential contribution counterterrorism success and sacrifices of Pakistan for peace and regional stability There are strategic contradictions in the US approach and most key regional and global players have not supported this declared US policy since it envisages India to be a Net Security Provider in the region Regional security in the st Century can only be ensured through relationships and collaborations based on mutual trust and equality he added He said that South Asia was undergoing an unprecedented transformation due to globalized economic trends and rising interdependencies wherein the prosperity and stability of one nation would be indivisible from others It is home to countries that share much with each other culturally and geographically but ironically progressing independently rather than in conjunction he said The possible reason for limited cooperation lies in deep rooted historic political differences due to colonial legacies and territorial disputes which have not allowed the environment of trust to prevail and is being exploited by the extra regional states for their geopolitical interests Khurram Dastgier said that political issues and conflicts had not allowed the strategic and economic interests of the region to take precedence He said amidst these complex security threats China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC as part of Belt and Road Initiative BRI was a significant flagship project which had gained global attention and had the potential to bring a paradigm shift in the destiny of this entire region But here the caveat is that peace amongst the regional countries is a pre requisite for success of this initiative The success of CPEC he said hinged on the ability to deal with intricate national security issues forging national consensus and preventing negative geo political influences in the region Cooperation between Pakistan and China is focused on economic development through connectivity and is not against any other country and seeks to establish and sustain long lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with the global and regional players he added Meanwhile there was unanimous agreement by the conference delegates that China had never changed its stance towards Pakistan and remained steadfast in supporting it at the international level China s push to block anti Pakistan statements in the recent BRICS Declaration is one example of that It was pointed that the CPEC is offering a development counter narrative to Balochistan s grievances and the Government of Pakistan should involve the local people and engage the country s young men and women in CPEC projects In the session on Regional Security and CPEC chaired by Dr Zafar Iqbal Cheema President and Executive Director Strategic Vision Institute SVI Dr A Z Hilali Chairman from the University of Peshawar provided a detailed overview of China s economic

Cooperation to End Extremism in the Region He said that engaging youth in projects covered under CPEC particularly roads railways solar and thermal power production would not only enhance their talent and skills but also utilize their energies in a positive manner Dr Khurram Iqbal from the National Defence University in his presentation opined that at the global level America s response to CPEC was difficult to read while the Corridor has made Russia s access to Warm Waters possible Within South Asia Afghanistan is a reluctant supporter of CPEC given its own internal economic imperatives whereas Bangladesh is playing both sides with Maldives and Nepal supporting the project enthusiastically He highlighted that India misperceived CPEC because it feared Pakistan might convert her newly acquired wealth into military muscle and obstruct India s rise Discussing CPEC s Impact on Pakistan Iran Security and Trade Relations Dr Mohammad Alam Khan from the University of Balochistan said Pakistan had specific security policy for India whereas Iran felt threatened by Israel and the US He stressed that Pakistan should invite Iran to join CPEC to minimize the influence of India in the region especially in Balochistan province in addition to providing a direct link between China and Iran Dr Mohammad Mujeeb Afzal from Quaid i Azam University said at the international level India was pushing its non violence and neutrality propaganda while at the regional level it was the polar opposite In his vote of thanks Ambassador r Abdul Basit President of IPRI thanked the participants media and the

Planning Development and Reforms said In the past the country was facing hour long electricity shortages Now electricity is available hours a day Ahsan Iqbal said development and improved standard of living was not possible without peace stability and harmony The world had entered the information age and countries were competing for economic ascendancy If there is a conflict then the development

explained the available opportunities in different sectors of economy He highlighted their potential to create employment at grass roots level and asked Chinese businesses to join joint ventures to make win win platforms for both themselves and Pakistani businessmen so as to develop and maintain goodwill by more mutual and partnership based relationship Ahsan Iqbal said CPEC should not be made controversial as it would bring about sustainable prosperity in Pakistan as well as the region He said there could not be sustained economic growth and development in an environment riven by deep mistrust and long standing disputes and conflicts South Asia needed to follow the Chinese ambitions of mutual development and common interests in order to give impetus to vision of shared destinies if the region wanted to become peaceful and prosperous Through CPEC he added South Asia would cease to be a corridor of conflict and become a corridor of cooperation But for this we need to continue engagement at all levels and remain firmly resolute in our commitment to peace he said adding CPEC was a collaborative project between the two most reliable partners in the world Pakistan and China especially given their time tested friendship The minister said think tanks academics business leaders around the globe were engaged in discussing CPEC which reflected its true potential and importance South Asians needed to come together and create an enabling environment to embrace security and well being which CPEC was offering Under the Vision he said the Government of Pakistan had envisaged the country as a hub of trade commerce and connectivity Critics may argue that the government is just building roads but in reality everything whether it is health services education or business needs better connectivity without which nothing is possible In the past it took two days to travel from Gwadar to Quetta its own provincial headquarter and now with the expressway it took eight hours he remarked Pakistan he said must learn from China which gave zero space to internal conflicts and focused on political and economic stability Speaking on the occasion Chinese Ambassador Sun Weidong said as a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative CPEC had entered the stage of early harvest Presently projects are under construction or completed with a total investment of US billion The CPEC projects have directly created thousands of local jobs Chinese enterprises always lay emphasis on training the youth talents and actively provide training opportunities he said

Belt and Road initiative since it had become a leading demonstration in the promotion of B and R as it now entered full implementation stage making smooth and satisfactory progress The ambassador shared that CPEC had cross border consensus from people of both sides because it followed principles of mutual partnership and peaceful development He explained that CPEC followed a new type of international relations based on win win cooperation by forging partnerships of dialogue with no confrontation on the basis of friendship rather than alliances China he stressed wanted to actively promote policy synergies rather than Cold War doctrinal divisions Providing data on China s future contributions to the world in next five years he said his country was expected to import goods worth USD trillion attract foreign investment worth USD billion and at the same time would be investing USD billion in other countries China and South Asia with their collective population of billion people he said would be the largest emerging market in the world and with the blueprint of CPEC finally becoming a reality with unprecedented development in four years The early harvest projects were now reaching fruition and growing like bamboo shoots across Pakistan he said Welcoming delegates to the conference IPRI President former ambassador Abdul Basit said peace was sine qua non for sustainable development and Pakistan had always strived for and continued to strive for normal relations with all its neighbours Our First Neighbour Policy is driven by national desire to move from conflict management to conflict resolution History tells us that we cannot build a sustainable and balanced regional cooperative framework on unpredictable and tenuous bilateral relations he said He expressed the hope that the deliberations would lead to improved understanding of the changing security situation in South Asia and help create synergies for a peaceful region In his opening remarks Omer Ali from the Hanns Seidel Foundation HSF co organizer of the conference pointed out that CPEC had put Pakistan in a much stronger negotiating position globally It was likely to increase direly needed cooperation with other neighbouring countries as it would raise many secluded layers of society from abject poverty he added In the session on Geopolitics of the Region and Development of CPEC chaired by former ambassador Inamul Haque Dr Farhan Hanif Siddiqi of the Quaid i Azam University reviewed the geo politico economic trends of South Asia vis a vis CPEC He pointed out that the world was witnessing a cult of the offensive at the geo political level and in midst of such seemingly intensifying agendas CPEC presented a radical break and opportunity to steer South Asia in the direction of mutual cooperation through economic inter linkages He said South Asia could not afford to continue on the path of confrontation and hostility if it wanted to become a powerful economic bloc Professor Dr Syed Rifaat Hussain of National University of Sciences and Technology NUST opined that South Asia was no longer a subordinate system as it had gained greater autonomy Discussing the Chinese

avenue of cooperation for many regional and extra regional countries to further their economic interests NBBALUedky Sino Pak relations flourish to new highs as CPEC picks up steam The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC is the buzz word in Pakistan ever since Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Pakistan and formally announced the Billion plus deal in April The CPEC is an integral part of the Belt and Road initiative which aims at connecting the natural deep seawater Gawadar port in the south of Pakistan with the Xinjiang region of China For China the CPEC would reduce the traveling distance for its huge volumes of trade with the Gulf countries from existing kilometers to mere kilometers While it will cut down the traveling time from the existing days to only days it will also reduce the cost of freight by one third For Pakistan it will help build and improve the much needed infrastructure to flourish the economy and boost trade according to an article posted on the website of China Radio International CRI Relations between Pakistan and China have remained strong over the years and CPEC has ensured that this bond of friendship becomes ironclad Last week Pakistan s Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif visited Beijing on an official visit and held a meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi The meeting ensured and strengthened confidence between the two nations which is evident from Wang Yi s remarks The real change of economic progress to which Wang Yi alluded to is not only going to be experienced at the macro level but will be experienced by people on the local level as well Ever since work on the CPEC began things have started to change for the better Roughly of the funding within the CPEC is allocated for energy projects in Pakistan some of these projects have become operational while work on others is underway and the issues of the electricity crisis will be resolved soon One has to keep in mind that Pakistan is an agrarian developing country whose economy has been drastically held back from registering the requisite levels of growth due to lack of technology and funding from abroad Even today agriculture sector is the mainstay of Pakistan s economy as it contributes around percent in the overall gross domestic product GDP but the poor farmers in Pakistan lack the modern technologies for farming to enhance their yields and for handling the supply chain of the agriculture goods The agriculture sector provides employment to percent of the country s total labour force The year saw dismal performance of the agriculture sector in Pakistan when it registered negative growth of percent against percent of the same period in last fiscal year The plan for the CPEC lays out that thousands of acres of agricultural land will be leased out to Chinese enterprises to set up demonstration projects in areas ranging from seed varieties to irrigation technology With the agriculture exchanges planned under CPEC poor farmers will be equipped with modern technologies and modern techniques of farming and this will not only benefit the common farmer folk but will also help ensure food security at a macro level in Pakistan and in return bolstering agriculture exports of Pakistan Recently various western media outlets have been propagating stories to spread ill will in Pakistan and abroad against the CPEC but such stories are not garnering traction within societies because positive changes owed to the CPEC are being felt by the local populace of Pakistan and the Chinese The local people in Gawadar are happy because of the developments in the region by Chinese companies A security guard named Qadeer Hussain stated I have children and because of the work under the CPEC now our community has a hospital which is catering to our health needs even small surgeries and emergency cases are being treated right next to the same hospital the Chinese people have also built a primary school where my children get to study in new classrooms with freshly painted desks Similar stories to Qadeer Hussain s and praises for the CPEC are reverberating through the areas where work on the CPEC is underway construction workers and even engineers working alongside the Chinese are benefiting from learning to new technologies and equipment plus gaining knowledge of new techniques for executing mega projects Similarly the economy of Xinjiang region in China is also witnessing positive change The Chinese people are benefiting from the open trade People of Xinjiang now have access to deep sea food from the Arabian Sea as it now takes hours for fresh sea food to reach Xinjiang from Gawadar Sixteen types of deep sea edibles items including lobsters and black sea bass are now being supplied to Xinjiang via the route of the CPEC Among the examples of advancements and benefits Alipay is another major change which the people of Pakistan are going to benefit from There are no secure online payments platforms like that of Alipay and Paypal in Pakistan It is expected that soon Alipay will be launched in Pakistan thus bringing a revolutionary change in the lives of the people Apart from Alipay even work is underway to launch G telecommunication networks in Pakistan through Chinese companies which will massively boost the communication infrastructure and services in the country Lastly apart from economic problems Pakistan has suffered immensely due to terrorism The CPEC will help curb the menace of terrorism in the region as rising economic activities will create jobs China has been busy in creating channels for peace to the region in tandem with the CPEC Recently China initiated a trilateral Foreign Ministers Forum between China Pakistan and Afghanistan The forum has earned traction as it helped ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan earlier this year The next meeting of the forum is expected to be held by the end of this year Wang Yi stated last week after his meeting with his Pakistani counterpart We have identified three priority areas which are strategic communication security dialogue and practical cooperation And on that basis we will work on the trilateral cooperation starting from the easier matters and with a goal of establishing a new platform for regional cooperation The CPEC has been termed as a game changer for Pakistan For China it is important for invigorating economic development in its Western regions The two countries have a lot to gain After last week s meeting between the two foreign ministers Foreign Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif s statement clearly summarizes the Pakistani sentiments towards China and CPEC when he said China and Pakistan have enjoyed friendly relations based on history mutual trust

s Ministry of Foreign Affairs NBBALUedmr Sino Pakistan relations evolving well to serve interest of both countries Analysts The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The Belt and Road Initiative brings China closer to the world Its objective to foster interconnectivity among different nations gradually becomes an issue of interest not only for directly involved stakeholders but also for outside observers endeavoring to assess the impact A current instance is Pakistan where its outgoing prime minister Nawaz Sharif has handed over power to Shahid Khaqan Abbasi a close ally As a matter of principle China prefers political stability and continuity while investing abroad but is also prepared to adjust to new developments In the case of Pakistan there should be no real concern for a dramatic change Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi advocates harmonious relations with China While being the minister for petroleum and natural resources for instance he publicly expressed his hope that Chinese oil and gas companies would invest in the energy sector as well as other Pakistan business sectors And now as prime minister he is vowing to implement the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC Further to this he decided to assign the Interior Ministry to Ahsan Iqbal who had been head of a commission tasked with building the CPEC according to an analysis published in a Chinese newspaper on Sunday In a meeting with the Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Sun Weidong he also talked about enhancement of bilateral relations beyond the CPEC China has congratulated him on his elevation convinced that a Pakistan government under his leadership will continue to work towards maintaining national unity and stability and boosting economic and social development While Pakistan is heading for a general election Sino Pakistani relations are evolving well to serve the interests of both countries The bilateral trade volume for example rose from about billion a decade ago to billion last year China is also becoming the country s largest donor During the first half of the current financial year it has provided million Moreover the realization of CPEC is now bringing about win win results China is thinking strategically and is in the process of creating new trade routes principally with its investments in Pakistan s Gwadar port to partly avoid some potential piracy problems at the Straits of Malacca as well as to reduce journey times A special report published by the Islamabad Institute of Conflict Resolution shows how many miles can be saved from central and western China to different world destinations via Pakistan in comparison to a totally sea borne connection via Shanghai According to the study miles would be saved to the Middle East and miles to Europe Moreover China is systematically supporting the development and industrialization of the Xinjiang region to enhance the new routes As far as Pakistan is concerned the CPEC critically contributes to its economic success Currently projects worth over billion are under construction out of which are related to the energy sector That is because Pakistan is suffering from an energy crisis and is looking for practical ways to overcome it in a sustainable way An analysis anticipates that billion worth of energy infrastructure might be constructed by private consortia to help alleviate Pakistan s chronic energy shortages These regularly amount to over MW and have contributed to an estimated shortfall of percent off the country s annual GDP Additionally China is offering jobs to Pakistani citizens Ambassador Sun Weidong has talked about local people being employed under the CPEC Obviously mutual benefits of cooperation go beyond these lines The attention however should also be turned towards existing challenges Security concerns cannot be ignored Pakistan is one of the worst hit countries in regard to terrorism and it is here where its new government has to concentrate in coordination with the international community Risks for China are evident however President Xi Jinping s vision is to support the Belt and Road Initiative for it to function as an umbrella of peace in the long term More time is obviously required to achieve this China is certainly helping Pakistan to achieve an equilibrium between stability reform prosperity and success In so doing it needs to improve its public image People to people exchanges are thus significant Cultural initiatives are equally playing a constructive role The launch of Xi The Governance of China book in Urdu is a positive step Prime Minister Shahid Abbasi and the new Pakistani government to be formed after the cannot but see China a long term partner thus expanding areas and fields of bilateral collaboration NBBALUedlat Pakistan actively implementing all CPEC projects Ambassador Kahlid The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Expressing satisfaction on progress of China Pakistan

Pak China relations Ambassador Khalid The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Terming friendship with China the cornerstone of Pakistan s foreign policy Pakistan Ambassador to China Masood Khalid Tuesday said the change of leadership in Pakistan would not affect the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC and Pak China relations There is no change in policy There is a new prime minister but the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz is the same ruling party The new prime minister has clearly stated that the projects will continue and increase So there is no doubt or ambiguity on that account he said in an interview in connection with Independence Day On the increasingly popular buzzword Batie which describes the unique relationship between China and Pakistan he said this is a beautiful word He said the friendship with China is the cornerstone of Pakistan s foreign policy We are close friends strategic partners and this friendship has evolved over the last years In fact our cooperation is growing which is a positive sign for the two countries Ambassador Khalid said there is mutual respect and interest and we believe that our friendship is true selfless and kind and has withstood the test of both good and bad times In Pakistan was hit by a big earthquake Subsequently freights appeared from China to give help and assistance After the earthquake in Sichuan Pakistanis and the government helped our Chinese friends These examples signify that if China is in need Pakistan is there to help in whatever way we can and vice versa he added So I truly respect the definition of Batie it means iron friend I think we have established a good foundation for our bilateral relations Our friendship will grow as we move along he added He said Pakistan is a developing country and has faced many challenges but it has overcome past challenges successfully We highly value our relationship with our friends Pakistan and China serve for regional peace and stability We welcome our Chinese guests on this occasion and a strong message of unity will be sent to the world Ambassador Khalid said around Chinese work in Pakistan and Pakistan government has taken responsibility of to provide requisite security protection For this purpose the Pakistani government has raised a special force including more than soldiers who provide security to Chinese working on CPEC projects throughout Pakistan adding in addition the four provinces are raising their own protection forces We will continue to do our bit and make security improvements he said and added Pakistan s security situation has improved About efforts to wipe out terrorism he said in the last two years we have cracked down on terrorism militants and their outlets in Pakistan to a great extent If you look at the figures you will find terrorist incidents in Pakistan have been considerably reduced he added Responding to a question about other challenges he said all mega projects face challenges and challenges come naturally He said the Belt and Road Initiative is a big initiative involving nearly a hundred countries and has to pass through many different countries territories cultures systems economies and taxation regimes These could be considered challenges He however expressed the confidence that this initiative is for the greater good of humanity of the global community and of the participating countries About the challenges to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC he said in when Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Pakistan both countries decided to launch the CPEC But after that both sides had to undergo long sessions with experts and officials which took about two years in order to reach consensus he added Both the countries discussed how to implement the plan how to finance it and how to translate it into reality which was a challenge He said principally the corridor was divided into four main cooperation areas energy infrastructure Gwadar Port development and industrial park and economic zone establishment adding Alongside we also worked on educational and cultural corridors to promote people to people connection Regarding the debates regarding participation of provinces in the CPEC he said the debate is a natural thing in the democratic and political system But I don t think it s a cause for concern There are provinces which need development more than others such as Balochistan so they are keen on the benefits of the project But all provinces will benefit he added About more interest taken by Chinese companies for investment in Pakistan he said a figure released last year in Pakistan showed Chinese investment in was more than billion which will continue to grow But if you put everything together the cumulative investment figure crosses more than billion but this depends on when projects start and finish Currently projects starting in different sectors could be worth around billion he added He said their investments are primarily in energy and infrastructure adding But now there is a trend of small and medium sized Chinese enterprises in textile cement energy and food sectors emerging in Pakistan we offer a good market for these areas Ambassador Khalid advised the Chinese companies to seriously look at Pakistan s entire market potential and firstly consider Pakistan geographical location of being near the Middle East Central Asia and Africa He said the concept behind the CPEC is linking Gwadar with Kashgar enabling Chinese exports to go straight through Pakistan to Central Asia the Middle East and Africa and with lower cost and shorter time Secondly Pakistan is rich in natural resources which remain untapped Labor is at low cost and more Pakistanis are learning Chinese he said and added also incentives facilities and tax exemptions are granted by the Pakistani government to foreign investors If you combine these factors I think Pakistan offers good business environments for Chinese he said On a map published by Indian media of China that excluded Tibet and Taiwan and also suggested that China is working with Pakistan to corner India he commented We also suffer from this mischief by the Indian media from time to time it s unfortunate I think the entire world recognizes Taiwan and Tibet are part of China I don t think stirring controversy is the right approach because this causes instability within bilateral relations and also in the region he added He made it clear that Pak China relationship is not against anyone it is for peace progress stability and regional development Peaceful co existence is our mutual policy But if a neighbor is aggressive we as sovereign states must defend our territories NBBALUedgf Flag hoisting ceremony held to mark Independence Day at Pakistan Embassy Beijing The

looks to Pacific Belt and Road will enhance cooperation former WTO chief The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times China proposed Belt and Road Initiative will play a role in the European Union s drive to engage with the Pacific Islands according to former head of the World Trade Organization WTO Pascal Lamy who made the remarks at a forum in Sydney on Thursday Lamy was in Australia as part of a two nation visit having visited New Zealand last week to discuss his belief that the European Union should more actively engage with the nations in the Pacific Ocean region At the event Lamy told Xinhua that the Belt and Road Initiative would play a role in facilitating the ease of connectivity between the European Union nations and the Pacific nations helped along by the increased development that has been pegged for the region by China and its initiative partners The Belt and Road Initiative is one signal which China is sending that cooperation is likely to grow Lamy said Lamy said that he believes that the China initiated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank AIIB will also assist in the development of what is currently an underdeveloped region I would not be surprised if the AIIB was to develop a relationship in this region Lamy said One of the key messages that Lamy a renowned champion of free trade wanted to emphasise was that in order for globalisation to truly be successful it will in his eyes be dependent on a rules based order for trade The rules of free trade will remain extremely important because trade is a question of trust and these rules play a big role in ensuring the sort of trust we need Lamy said Lamy was adamant that the value of having a rule book for trade will be crucial into the future and stressed that despite larger countries often having disputes the rules of trade and the super national global environment will hopefully ensure all parties abide by the determinations of the WTO despite recent actions in some quarters The learned trade leader said he believes that geo economics will trump geo politics and that the relationship between China and the United States will continue to prosper and grow We now live in a planet that is so interwoven interconnected interdependent the costs of de globalization are now so high that we should be protected from de globalization Lamy said Having studied the past and looking to the future Lamy said that he believes that China will continue to have a large role to play in the shaping of the world s trade environments Asia will have a much bigger role in this world and China has a much bigger role than it had years ago Proposed by China in the Belt and Road Initiative refers to the Silk Road Economic Belt and the st Century Maritime Silk Road aiming at building a trade and

above expectation So clearly growth is proceeding at pace Strong Chinese growth drives growth particularly in Asian region but also throughout the world Obstfeld added noting that China is a big contributor to the overall growth and has a very large spillover effect to the world economy As China is transforming its economy from traditional manufacturing sector to service and consumption oriented sector its structural transformation and the rebalancing of its economy should lower the growth rate and put growth on a firmer basis over time the chief economist said It s very important

concerns on China s credit driven growth and some vulnerabilities in its financial systems that could derail growth but he also pointed out that The Chinese government is clearly recognizing these issues and has taken actions The recent strengthened coordination between the People s Bank of China and the State Council on financial oversight is a big step forward that will lead to more effective oversight of the financial markets he said China announced that it will set up a committee under the State Council to oversee financial stability and development during the recent National Financial Work Conference Obstfeld said China has entered the debate of globalization in a positive way which will be helpful not only to major economies but also for other countries China could take concrete

and establishing biological and wildlife corridors Biodiversity sites along the Corridor will be preserved and developed He said Azad Kashmir is ideal for eco tourism because that too is an emerging industry It is our responsibility to preserve our natural habitats with as much seriousness as we pursue industrialization We are also striving to get a tourism corridor included in the framework of CPEC he added AJK the President said is also conscious of the environmental aspects of the four projects approved under the CPEC He admitted the fact that there were environmental challenges in AJK which he added need to be addressed industrial and vehicular emissions would increase farmlands will be affected and water would be used on a massive scale during construction and industrial development The five dam Indus Cascade being developed under CPEC will have environmental consequences but they need not be adverse Mitigation measures should be taken simultaneously Large water reservoirs upstream can help regulate water flows and water supply downstream and make them predictable the President said Masood Khan revealed that AJK was building its own cascades down the Jhelum Neelam and Poonch Rivers and their tributaries The construction of the Neelum Jhelum Jagran Patrind Kohala Mahal Azad Pattan Karot and Gulpur hydropower projects will start an energy revolution These

hybrids he recealed Precautions would be taken in the survey of roads that should avoid landslides and unnecessary disruption of forests and wildlife Cutting down of trees for building roads should be accompanied by proportionate and in fact surplus a forestation he underlined Masood Khan further said that mainstreaming environment in the CPEC entails effective monitoring and oversight and in this regard government regulators civil society and the media should play an active role From time to time independent evaluation of environmental impact should also be commissioned while keeping in mind that infrastructure development and self sufficiency in energy are imperative for Azad Kashmir and Pakistan he said The AJK President said that the State Government has focused its due energies on developing requisite capacities refining guidelines on Environmental Impact Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment under the relevant legislation EIAs however should be conducted more regularly and rigorously The AJK government he said is in the initial phase of designing the zone in Mirpur and we can make environment a keystone for it and other CPEC projects to follow The CPEC projects in Azad Kashmir will be made sustainable both economically and environmentally We need modern industrial infrastructure but it should also be conceived and implemented with the environmental impact in mind he added The President said while taking all necessary measures we should not paint an environmental doomsday scenario in Azad Kashmir Azad Kashmir would project a confident image of a state that will be able to proactively resolve the issues related to raising an industrial zone These include industrial and hazardous waste management and disposal solid waste management in general water treatment emission control and socio economic impact of the zone on the population of Mirpur and adjoining areas Sardar Masood said that self evident that economic development and environmental protection are closely linked In modern day planning the two cannot and should not be separated Environmental Impact Assessment EIA should therefore be integrated into all development projects There should be no two opinions about this he suggested He pointed out that eve before the launch of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC in Pakistan needed to embrace green and environment friendly technologies With a construction boom urbanization and industrialization biodiversity in Pakistan was at risk he said He recalled that October deadly earthquake and the floods had shown fragility of our ecosystems as well as their vulnerability to natural disasters But the awareness levels response and preparedness and strategies to deal with climate change were not up to speed he observed The President emphasized the need of highlighting adequately the concrete measures which have been taken by Chinese and Pakistani planners and their corporate entities to incorporate environmental dimensions in CPEC s land and marine projects He called for focusing to achieve the objectives of the project which we will have to develop an overall environment friendly culture The AJK Government

Charg d affaires Chinese Embassy Islamabad Lijian Zhao will be key note speakers of the forum The aim of the forum is to help foster better understanding for future prospects and challenges in implementation of CPEC Director of PCC Hamayoun Khan Monday said the forum would discuss how Pakistan could benefit more from CPEC which was flagship project of Chinese President s Belt and Road Initiative He said the PCC was determined to continue safeguarding the position and interests of Pakistan as well as of China through its activities in future The PCC is a think tank that was established in a year before initiation of CPEC in view of significance of expanding Sino Pak bilateral relations NBBALUedih Belt and Road plays key role in joint terror fight Scholars The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The Belt and Road is aimed at carrying forward the contribution of the ancient Silk Roads but is quite different as it attaches more importance to connecting interests that is to benefiting all countries involved Some scholars hold that its expansion on land will muscle into the regions blighted by frequent extremist and terrorist activities in Central Asia and the Middle East Consequently the initiative will urgently help to enlarge cooperation in the war on terror said Ding Gang a senior fellow with the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China Effective positive counter terror cooperation needs the connectivity of interests As the Belt and Road project keeps advancing and attracting an increasing number of countries and enterprises common interests will help build up mutual trust which constitutes the foundation for the fight against terrorism he said in his article published by Global Times In the past as the countries regions and especially people along the Belt and Road were not so closely bound up their common interests could hardly converge which gave rise to terrorist and extremist activities But if they get connected it will be a different scenario One of the five connections rolled out by the initiative is establishing connectivity through infrastructure With improved infrastructure access people will see common interests thus denting their feeling of being abandoned by globalization When development is made possible there will be a stronger demand to safeguard security in a concerted effort For instance the under construction China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC connects infrastructure projects forming a foundation for cooperation and common development In this way the countries involved will think of ways to deal with terrorists because my problem is your problem as well This region is confronted with rather a severe challenge in tackling terrorism but we will establish security mechanisms to keep the paths clear once we share roads highways and rails China and Pakistan have already been making efforts in this regard The same is true of anti terror cooperation between China and India The two nations started negotiations on combating surging terrorist threats years ago but have barely made any breakthroughs One of the most important reasons lies in a lack of mutual trust The key to the Belt and Road lies in the connectivity of interests Discovering and developing more common interests among different countries and regions through the Belt and Road will boost their cooperation in addressing many a conundrum NBBALUedel Chinese company contracted to build Pakistan s largest airport The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times China

Pakistan is of the early recipients of the One Belt One Road initiative of Chinese President His Excellency President Xi and the Government of Pakistan has developed a policy framework which is flexible enough to provide for all forms assistance to the initiative He was addressing International Infrastructure Investment Forum at Beijing China today The Secretary said that Chinese Government s Belt and Road initiative is a right step in the right direction He said that AIIB Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank is yet another initiative by China which will provide access to concessional financing for high priority infrastructure projects which may not be of interest to commercial investors Younus Dagha said that matching the aspirations of a developing nation for achieving higher and rapid growth for their economies provides a daunting challenge for the policy makers to provide enabling policy framework for financing the required infrastructure He said that Pakistan has been framing policies to facilitate financing in its infrastructure projects especially in the Energy Sector since We are working with many international investor companies which are providing electricity to the Grid on Built Operate Own Transfer basis since s and early years of this century The Secretary said that the effectiveness of Pakistan s policy framework can be judged from the current situation where the Chinese contractors are enthusiastically bidding for all categories of the infrastructure projects in Pakistan from Roads to Railways and from Coal Power Plants to the clean energy projects They are now actively working with us to extend the scope of their involvement into Telecom and Transmission projects he added Mr Dagha said that the forms of financing available for these projects are of all possible types which include outright investment as well as the projects where the contractors arrange the financing In many cases where the financing has been arranged by the project sponsors he said the Chinese companies only participate as contractors without any financing obligations Such projects are mostly where the financing has come from the public sector development outlay but in many cases the financing also comes from foreign banks other than the Chinese Mr Younus Dagha said that when Pakistan s economy was struggling with the challenge to finance power plants to meet the large energy deficit in the Chinese government offered the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC initiative worth billion US Dollars through which the Chinese Government its companies and contractors will invest or get finance for all types of infrastructure projects which includes MWs from power projects ranging from Coal to Hydro electric as well as wind and solar Gas pipeline Sea port Airport Railways and Roads This in addition to the already on going projects in Pakistan both in public and private sectors provide attractive opportunities for the Chinese contractors he added The Secretary said that it is then not surprising that a Chinese company is the lead investor in MWs Coal fired power plant at Port Qasim and at the same time an EPC contractor at a Public Sector MWs Gas based Power Project at Haveli Bahadur Shah Another Chinese company is becoming the largest IPP Independent Power Producer in Pakistan by its three projects on Jehlum River cascade which will bring more than MWs of Clean hydropower and also MWs of Wind projects under construction he said that there are numerous Chinese Companies which are currently working in Pakistan since past several years and have found the experience improving with every new policy framework The growing portfolio of infrastructure projects in Pakistan keeps on satisfying their appetite he added The Secretary said that growing capacity of the Chinese infrastructure contactors also present a challenge for the Chinese policy makers to provide for more flexible access to finance especially for their projects in the developing countries NBBALUecm China Pak Economic corridor s foundation laid down in s The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times The initiative China Pakistan economic corridor was announced in its foundations were laid as early as the s with the air corridor The Karakoram Highway and later the construction of Gwadar Port Apparently an energy and economic corridor it is in fact a framework for holistic development It puts equal emphasis on social sectors and would kick off a process which would have a far reaching impact on the development of the whole region and the world at large According to director general of the Institute of Policy Studies in Islamabad the significance of the CPEC can be imagined as it is a key link in China s Belt and Road Initiative which involve billion people across countries on three continents While the Belt and Road Initiative the Silk Road Economic Belt and st Century Maritime Silk Road is a pivotal strategy for China President Xi Jinping s vision is not confined to creating a trade route but a community of shared interests fate and responsibilities This vision is based on the understanding that technological developments can only be fully exploited when the physical infrastructure for transporting people goods and services are in place fully developed and supported by friendly policies legislation and procedures with a win win approach Areas along the CPEC would have the potential to become a trade transit transport and economic and energy hub for regional progress and development as well Once the project was announced the first task at the operational level was to develop a consensus on what the CPEC would involve and its various components such as the mechanisms for regular consultations the cooperation modes and how it would be financed Likewise for specific projects as they were identified and agreed Measures to address the volatile security situation have also been a priority on the agenda Looking back on the project s first year one finds that not only a deep understanding on essential issues has been reached a lot of development on the ground has also commenced It is expected that the Early Harvest plans will be completed in the stipulated timeframe that is by March As to the security aspect a Special Security Division has been established in Pakistan for the CPEC It is already operational and thousands of security personnel have been deployed in various parts of the country along with CPEC projects However a pertinent question often raised in light of the political and diplomatic landscape of the region is with so much bilateral regional and global significance attached to the project will it not face any counter moves by adversaries of the two countries While the answer may not be difficult to perceive the strategy in this regard primarily revolves around developing stakeholders of all concerned in the project At the same time as progress has been made on the ground the interest and attention being given to CPEC at the highest level by the two countries leaderships ensure that effective and timely notice will be taken to counter all negative moves Indeed the strong level of trust between the two countries that has remained the key factor in their relationship over the last six decades will be further enhanced with the CPEC It will take the relationship to new heights in the coming decades and spread benefits to South Central and West Asia as well NBBALUecrv China Pakistan are all weather strategic partners President Xi The Balochistan

Dushanbe to China s Xinjiang province before connecting to the Karakoram highway that connects China to Pakistan The World Bank has also entered into a co financing deal with AIIB although it is not yet known what kind of projects it will choose to fund In case the World Bank agrees to support a project analysts said the ambitious Chinese program will end up obtaining one of the highest forms of endorsements that can open up many other financial options The One Belt One Road policy which has been spearheaded by Xi Jinping is one of his key agendas as China s leader The project is a combination of a new plan which seeks to link China s western region with Central Asia Europe and the Middle East The maritime trade routes or Belt pass through Southeast Asia and on to Africa It is possible that the AIIB choose to co finance its first project in Pakistan with the ADB in an effort to assuage suspicions that the project reflects China s geopolitical priorities said Paul Haenle director of the Beijing based Carnegie Tsinghua Center for Global Policy But he thinks that the new bank which has member countries should be judged only after it has conducted more lending operations It is essential to wait and see if the AIIB finances projects outside the Belt and Road Initiative he said The Beijing backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank AIIB has chosen two projects to sponsor for its first foray into infrastructure investment and both are linked to Chinese President Xi Jinping s new plan But in an apparent move to help deflect criticism that AIIB has a political

Sukur to Multan and Karakorum highway upgradation project will start soon Orange Line project in Lahore has started CPEC is becoming an important platform for deepening the two countries concrete cooperation and really is the flagship project of One Belt One Road To date Pakistan government has identified industrial parks Among them initially the free trade zone of Haier Ruba industrial park phase two and free trade zone of Gwadar will be launched Other industrial parks will be decided by both sides through mutual consultations Ambassador Masood Khalid expressed hope that these industrial parks will be along the entire route of CPEC and thus lead to the whole economic development of Pakistan When it came to the significance of One Belt One Road initiative Ambassador Masood Khalid said One Belt One Road sticks to the notion of build and share and it shares the same development goal and direction with Pakistan The construction of CPEC is an important consensus reached by the leaders of China and Pakistan It will optimize the trade and energy cooperation between China and Pakistan and benefit billion people in China South Asia and Middle East He pointed out that CPEC is the catalyst of regional economic integration peace and stability People say that the territory of Pakistan is like a corridor which connects China and Arabian Sea and Pakistan is a bridge between China

CPEC will become a model for China to build shared destiny with other neighboring countries NBBALUecab CPEC forms a new regional geopolitical dynamic Chinese media The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC will probably form a new regional geopolitical dynamic and it is hoped that certain countries that hold a narrow minded perspective on the project could change their mind and engage in the project as a constructive player In this way the CPEC can yield the greatest profits for all stakeholders says Chinese Daily Global Times in an article published on Thursday The article was compiled by its correspondent Liu Zhun based on an interview with Ahsan Iqbal Minister of Planning Reform and Development Although treasured as an all weather friendship and an iron brotherhood the Sino Pakistani relationship does not really live up to this reputation in economic terms For example China only ranks th among all direct investors in Pakistan However the lopsidedness is expected to be rectified in the next ten years as the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC a collection of projects that can immensely intensify the connection between both countries is planned to be finished in The billion project has been described as a pivotal point in Sino Pakistani relations It was designed as part of China s Belt and Road mega initiative but aims at boosting the mutual benefits of both countries Through the project China can develop a much shorter more cost efficient and geopolitically safer route for imports and exports In Pakistan Chinese companies will find a huge and reliable market for infrastructure goods and talent For Pakistan the CPEC will act as the main artery to re vitalize the country s economy especially in terms of energy and infrastructures Given Pakistan s location at the intersection of Central South and West Asia the project will greatly ramp up Pakistan s leverage in the regional geopolitical landscape The CPEC will be a game changer for Pakistan So far the CPEC is proceeding well Pakistan has placed an unprecedented emphasis and priority on the project which is reflected by a unanimous agreement by all political forces in Pakistan in spite of the country s multi party democratic system There was a heated debate in Pakistan about the CPEC which aroused some concerns in China However the disagreement is not about the feasibility of the project but how to divide the big cake as all regions in Pakistan want to maximize their profits from the project This is quite common for a multi party country Attaching great importance to the project might have left the impression to the public that Pakistan is too reliant on the CPEC and some might wonder what if the project fails Such concerns are quite speculative without solid evidence I don t see any risks that could lead to the collapse of the project Both countries are eager to increase their connectivity in multiple spheres and what one side offers can exactly tally with what the other side wants There are no conflicts of interest between China and Pakistan on the project We cannot deny that the possibility of side effects exists during the implementation of a mega project like the CPEC For example environmental concerns exist as both sides are engaged in gigantic cross border infrastructure projects Chinese products by relying on their competitive advantage could impact Pakistani brands and security issues might make Chinese companies think twice before getting involved But these concerns have been informed and shared by the leadership of both countries at the initial stage of the implementation of the CPEC Political consensus over mutual concerns could result in constructive official involvement in specific problems For example we have agreed that Chinese companies should be encouraged to transfer certain technology to Pakistan in exchange for more shares in the Pakistani market In joint ventures Pakistan should hold a certain percentage of shares so that cooperation is on an equal footing And Pakistan will continue deploying elite squads to protect the route These agreements for actual reciprocity are essential to the smooth operation of the CPEC The mechanism which is established on the basis of the special relationship between Pakistan and China is unique and will guarantee the success of the project NBBALUecf China says it s dealing with Masood Azhar issue as per relevant resolutions The Balochistan Times NBBALU c The Balochistan Times Foreign Ministry

Commerce and Industry PCJCCI has called for developing an information silk road for having maximum benefits out of economic corridor to be constructed by China in the Asia Pacific region PCJCCI President Shah Faisal Afridi said here that roads and railways were easy enough to build but it was hard to cultivate mental harmony among people that holds more importance in regional connectivity Information has become a core resource and is crucial to international cooperation The next leap for regional connectivity is to create Asia Pacific Information Superhighway he said adding that infrastructure development was progressing steadily for the China proposed Belt and Road Initiative but parallel with a communication and infrastructure network connecting Asia Europe and Africa there was a dire need to break the barriers of information among the connecting nations Afridi elaborated that people to people bond provides the public support for implementing strategic initiatives We should carry forward the spirit of friendly cooperation of the Silk Road by promoting extensive cultural academic personnel exchanges and cooperation among media youth and volunteers so as to win public support for deepening bilateral and multilateral harmony he said The PCJCCI suggested various strategies to promote a well synchronized intellectual and business environment among the silk route countries He said We should expand the scope and scale of bilateral currency swap and settlement with other countries along the Belt and Road apart from opening and developing the bond market in Asia and making joint efforts to establish the joint financial institutions like Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and BRICS New Development Bank which will pave way for carrying out multilateral financial cooperation in the form of syndicated loans and bank credits in the region through China ASEAN Interbank Association and SCO Interbank Association he maintained Afridi pointed out that Pakistan had a vast role to play for bridging the gap between political parties and the parliaments of the nations situated alongside the Silk Road He proposed to develop a concrete agenda to initiate an effective communication process among the states being connected through Pak China economic belt as well as the Silk Road The agenda should specially include friendly exchanges of the respective legislative bodies and political parties He expressed confidence that present government of Pakistan was quite capable of taking successful initiatives in this regard He hoped that such initiatives would emerge Pakistan as a leader of the region which would make us able to supersede the so called influence of India in the neighboring countries He assured of his fullest cooperation on behalf of the Pak China Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry in this move which would also have the fullest support of all Chinese Companies operating in Pakistan Meanwhile Wang Zihai Chairman Association of all Chinese companies working in Pakistan has also appreciated the idea of the PCJCCI for developing an information super highway in the Asia pacific region To materialize this idea he has proposed to

The Balochistan Times Northwest China s Xinjiang held a forum to discuss cooperation on the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC a major project in China s Belt and Road Initiative More than officials and delegates from companies think tanks and social organizations of the two countries attended the first China Pakistan Economic Corridor Forum held in the oil rich city of Karamay China Daily reported on Wednesday The two day event features six sub forums on topics including city to city and industrial cooperation and youth exchange The forum is expected to issue a manifesto elaborating the goals of CPEC and sign a number of cooperation agreement An economic corridor linking Pakistan s Gwadar Port to China s Xinjiang with highways railways and pipelines the CPEC is among the six economic corridors crucial to China s Silk Road Economic Belt and st Century Maritime Silk Road NBBALUebdl Pakistan China expand economic dimension of their ties Dar The Balochistan Times NBBALU XXXVIII c The Balochistan Times Finance Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar has said that Pakistan and China have greatly expanded the economic dimension of their relationship as a key priority The China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC was a flagship initiative in this regard which would speed up economic cooperation and connectivity he said in an interview withh CCTV NEWS China We have several institutional mechanisms in place such as Pakistan China FTA and the Pakistan Joint Economic Committee as well which would boost trade and investment in the years to come Ishaq Dar said that two countries had upgraded their strategic partnership to an All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership formalized in the joint statement issued during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinpings to Pakistan The political leadership level interaction had increased which would of course further deepen this relationship he remarked Highlighting the significance of Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank AIIB the minister said that the bank would provide financing support to developing countries in Asia including Pakistan for infrastructure development in order to promote regional connectivity We believe that the bank will be an important platform to convert the abundant savings available in the region into investment to help regional economies to achieve sustainable and rapid development thereby contributing to the world economy he added The minister said that Pakistan had been supporting the initiative right from the initial announcement for the establishment of AIIB The bank he said would provide additional financing to support the establishment of infrastructure projects including construction of roads dams power projects etc He expected that the bank would cooperate with the existing multilateral development banks by providing co financing for the development of infrastructure projects in the member countries However he said that the bank would also aim to be leaner and faster than the existing institutions and it would provide some healthy competition The AIIB he added would distinguish itself from other multilateral development banks MDB like the World Bank WB and the Asian Development Bank ADB because MDBs major focus was on poverty reduction while the AIIB would focus on infrastructure development and regional connectivity Ishaq Dar said A regional bank provides an excellent framework for decisions about projects and financing particularly those with cross border implications at regional level Pakistan he said had always extended support to China at regional and international fora We believe this is another of Chinas sincere efforts to help out developing countries that are left out of the race for economic development otherwise due to lack of support from international financial institutions he added He said the banks which had been previously shouldering responsibilities for lending were already overburdened and therefore there had to be some new institution that could come in handy at this critical juncture Infrastructure development and poverty alleviation was needed for nations like Pakistan in Asia to ward off the dangers of extremism and I think AIIB is a hope for all of us in Asia he noted Replying to a question about China Pakistan Friendship Year Dar said that Pakistan China friendship was all weather and time tested It is an evergreen relationship that has its roots in the hearts and minds of the people of Pakistan and China It has been the constant endeavour of our government to add more depth and breadth to this all important relationship he added As strategic partners he said Pakistan and China had always enjoyed excellent cooperation across a diverse range of areas and sectors However he said Our two governments have placed a special emphasis on enlarging the economic footprint of this relationship We believe that the peoples of both countries should enjoy the fruits of this special relationship As a result he added both the countries were cooperating on a number of people centric projects The highlight of these projects of course was the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC which we regard as a game changer for our countries as well as the region at large he said Dar said that the Corridor and its related projects would deliver jobs and prosperity to millions of people in both countries Replying to another question regarding Chinese Presidents visit to Pakistan in April this year he said this was President Xi Jinpings first visit after assuming office in March and the first by a Chinese President since November This visit was the hallmark of Pakistan China Year of Friendly Exchanges The highlight of the visit he said was the signing of over agreements memorandums of understanding relating to key development projects in infrastructure energy and communication sectors under the umbrella of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC in the governmental and private sector Important agreements relating to areas of cooperation outside the CPEC were also concluded which would go a long way in changing the destiny of the people of the two countries he added Ishaq Dar said that the CPEC was being conceived as a lynchpin of plans by both China and Pakistan to deepen their economic cooperation Early implementation of the CPEC would be transformational for Pakistans economy and dovetail perfectly with Chinas strategy of developing its inland and western regions he added He said that Chinas interest in the project was also strategically driven by President Xi Jinpings visionary concept of integrating regions and countries across the globe under the Silk Road Economic Belt and the st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative It envisages deepening policy coordination amongst countries and regions extending and improving infrastructure connectivity in all its forms road air sea rail telecommunications energy etc across regions fostering trade and investment flows and last but not the least enhancing people to people connectivity The CPEC fits naturally into this vision of a Road and Belt with Gwadar and Karachi serving as its southern nodes and an outlet to the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf he added The minister said that regional and sub regional economic integration as a means to bolster growth investment and trade in countries had a long chequered history However he said the recent history of regional economic integration had had some unmistakable successes In fact this had been one of the major successful developments after the Second World War he added Ishaq Dar said that the regional integration in Europe brought success in terms of regional growth economic development investment and trade and more importantly fostered peace in the region Hence Asia can also benefit by following the same pattern In this respect the Corridor can provide an integrating platform for over three billion people in Central West and South Asia the Middle East and Africa regions he added He said that the increase in trade investment digitalization and financial flows would bring peace and prosperity to the region through enhancement in the competitiveness of the economies of the countries contribute to reducing regional disparities and social inequality and improve life expectancy and quality of life in every country and in the region Thus in real terms he added it could re open the economic artery blocked for years as said by my Chinese brother This shall become even more relevant when we look at future forecasts that Asia and Pacific regions share in world GDP between and is expected to rise from nearly from to more than per cent with China accounting for per cent and India for per cent he remarked Replying to yet another question Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan had always been upfront and committed towards the issues dear to Chinas core interests matching the consistent support friendship and cooperation provided by both countries to one another President Xi Jinping he said had provided a visionary concept of integrating regions and countries across the globe under the Silk Road Economic Belt and the st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative representing a new model of regional and South South cooperation which would offer new opportunities for Asias rejuvenation and the common prosperity of all countries Dar said that it envisaged deepening policy coordination amongst countries extending and improving infrastructure connectivity in all its forms road air rail telecommunications energy etc across regions fostering trade and investment flows and last but not the least enhancing people to people connectivity Regional integration he said thus became a key driver for stimulating growth It is bound to enable sharing of the fruits of growth across countries and regions and bring peace and prosperity to the regions that it envelops Pakistan firmly supports and will actively take part in the building of the Belt and Road as it believes it will serve the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples and contribute to peace stability and development in the region and beyond CPEC is an important project of the Belt and Road initiatives as it provides a link between the road and the sea route and in President Xis words it is where the two meet It also has same developmental goals which will bring peace harmony and prosperity along the Corridor in the region and the world When asked about the cooperation structure with the CPEC at the center and the Gwadar Port transport infrastructure energy and industrial cooperation being the four key areas to achieve a win win result and common development he said that the cooperation structure framework was a beautiful concept given by President Xi to which the Pakistani government had fully endorsed as it summarized the concept of the Corridor simply yet beautifully The goal of China Pak Economic Corridor he said was to facilitate and intensify economic activity along the Corridor It envisages connectivity and expansion of trade and investment through a network of roads rail fiber optic cables and energy pipelines It also provides for the creation of special economic zones industrial parks and trade centers and development of energy and technical cooperation The CPEC he said would connect the nodes of growth center in such a manner that the fruits of the development would benefit all areas provinces of Pakistan consistent with scientific planning parameters Further he said it would be connected with trade facilitation corridors dedicated freight corridors energy corridors trade logistics corridor telecommunication corridor etc Therefore he said the CPEC was not just name of a project but was a comprehensive package of cooperative initiatives and projects which covered the key areas including connectivity information network infrastructure energy cooperation industries and industrial parks agricultural development and poverty alleviation tourism financial cooperation as well as livelihood improvement including municipal infrastructure education public health and people to people communication Hence he said when we look at each of the said element it fits in one of the key area of the framework resulting in community of shared destiny to ensure the perpetual continuity into friendship of our two countries from generation to generation Regarding the role of the Gwadar Port play in the Belt and Road initiative he said that the port had the potential of becoming an energy transportation hub due to its proximity to Strait of Hormuz a key shipping route It will not only be very vital for bilateral trade for Pakistan and China but shall also provide immense opportunities for the CentralAsian region as well as the surrounding region which is home to around rd of the worlds oil reserves Currently he said the goods and energy transportation for China goes through Strait of Malacca which raises the cost of transportation in addition of poses security challenges due to being a longer route Ishaq Dar expected that the development of CPEC would on average reduce distance of km for China approximately on average it takes days for ship starting from the Middle East or Africa to reach Chinese ports and vice versa in addition to local transportation In comparison it would take around days to reach Gwadar Port which will have commercial importance for the economies by cutting time distance and cost Further it also provides risk management opportunities Empirical analysis of other regional examples especially in South East Asia he said suggested that multiple ports operating in regional countries had led to trade volume expansion and not contraction for the early players in the business The new ports in other parts of the world actually became new nodes for trade activity opening up those regions for international trade which were hitherto closed off or inaccessible he said In addition he said the existing ports had their own core competencies on the basis of which they were providing their unique value propositions The transshipment business can also open new opportunities that will arise by reducing the transportation cycle costs and by investing in the freight forwarding and transshipment opportunities in Gwadar which shall be beneficial for Pakistan China and other land locked central Asian states he added Competitive cooperation in such a manner he said provides financial incentive to the participants helps in changing behaviours removes discontentment disparity and creation of jobs leading to peace development prosperity and harmony History is also witness to the fact that trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the civilizations of China the Indian subcontinent Persia Europe the Horn of Africa and Arabia by opening long distance political and economic relations between the civilizations The main traders during antiquity were the Chinese Persians Somalis Greeks Syrians Romans Armenians Indians and Bactrians and from the th to the th century the Sogdians he added During the coming of age of Islam he said Arab traders became prominent Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China many other goods were traded along with religious and syncretic philosophies and various technologies In addition to economic trade he added the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network as well thus becoming game changer for those civilizations Hence today he said China and Pakistan along with other countries along the route would also benefit similarly and investing in these initiatives would prove to be a game changer fate changer for all participatory economies states NBBALUebb New Compound of Chinese Embassy to become icon of Pak China friendship NA Speaker The

treaty talks The Baluchistan Times NBBALU c Asianet Pakistan ISLAMABAD Widespread global mercury contamination of seafood has been shown besides health effects from methyl mercury in seafood occurring below the level that was considered safe just a few years ago revealed three reports The Zero Mercury Working Group ZMWG in cooperation with the Biodiversity Research Institute BRI and Sustainable Development Policy Institute SDPI is facilitating the release of the three reports The level of mercury in the Pacific Ocean is projected to increase by by if current pollution trends continue unabated said Dr Mahmood A Khwaja Senior Advisor Chemicals and Sustainable Industrial Development Sustainable Development Policy Institute Islamabad He said this is a wake up call for all governments to stem the rising tide of mercury pollution and finalize a strong treat he added The estimated maximum and minimum emission and transfer of mercury in Pakistan is approximately and kg per year respectively The major uses of mercury in the country are in the production of a chlor alkali plant followed by lighting sources dental amalgams The new scientific findings are to be presented at the start of the fifth and final round of United Nations negotiations to put in place a legally binding global treaty to reduce mercury use and pollution The legal text negotiated by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee is expected to be completed on January in Geneva The latest science points to the need for strict reduction measures to address the global mercury crisis said Elena Lymberidi Settimo co coordinator of ZMWG at the European Environment Bureau in Brussels Belgium Among other science findings include larger predatory fish such as swordfish shark and certain species of tuna are often listed in national fish consumption advisories due to higher mercury concentrations Different seafood varieties can differ by at least fold in their average mercury content Seafood regularly consumed by people contains mercury concentrations that commonly exceed safe levels based upon US EPA standards However there are also plenty of low mercury seafood alternatives with high omega benefits Several recent epidemiological studies clearly show that the consumption of ordinary amounts of fish can cause an unsafe risk to the developing foetus and children suggesting that the current health exposure tolerance levels should be revised to reflect the latest scientific findings We believe it is crucial to understand global baseline mercury concentrations in order to make appropriate decisions on how to evaluate the effectiveness of the treaty said David C Evers Ph D Executive Director of BRI and a member of the UNEP Fate and Transport Partnership Group NBBALUeci th Asian Buffalo

changed the venue to a military school But even so India s security strategy observers and media paid close attention to the military exercise Liu Zongyi a senior fellow of Shanghai Institutes for International Studies said on Friday He said it is a normal development for China to hold a military exercise with Nepal as Nepal is China s friendly neighbour There are many countries which have held joint military exercises including India with China Now that China and Nepal have developed closer economic relations Nepal hopes to join China s Belt and Road initiative for which regional security and stability is a necessity In addition Nepal is located in an earthquake zone with frequent occurrence of natural disasters In the earthquake Nepal suffered a great loss China s active participation in Nepal s post earthquake relief has left a deep impression on Nepal Through the joint military exercise China and Nepal can learn from each other about disaster relief techniques and thus accumulating experience for dealing with disasters The joint military exercise shows that the bilateral diplomatic relations have expanded from political economic and cultural to the field of military defense But for China this is just one aspect of the overall national security outlook proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping It hopes to strengthen cooperation with countries around the world in security improve the neighbourly friendship pattern promote the development of common destiny with surrounding countries and work together to deal with various issues so as to realize the goal of sharing dignity sharing fruits of development and sharing security For Nepal the joint military exercise has a deeper significance For starters it shows that Nepal moves forward in its pursuit of a balanced diplomacy among major powers Since the s balanced diplomacy has become the basic principle of Nepal s foreign strategy which is established based on Nepal s nationalism and anti Indian sentiment Nepal s dependence on India in political economic cultural and other aspects as well as India s ambition to make Nepal its sphere of influence has made most people in Nepal fear losing their national independence as Sikkim did In addition Nepal is not only worried about terrorism and extremism but also national separatism Holding joint military exercises with China can contribute to deterring ethnic separatism in Nepal Whether it is for China or Nepal the joint military drill is aimed at maintaining regional peace and national stability Nepal has taken a cautious attitude to avoid provoking India The drill does not violate the Treaty of Peace and Friendship inked by Nepal and India in Page of Factiva Inc Due to geographic political economic historic religious and cultural factors India has wielded much bigger influence over Nepal than China Nepal cannot cut its economic ties with India The Indian security and strategic circle has watched the joint drill between Beijing

a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China and a senior researcher at the Center for China and Globalization said on Thursday Proposed by President Xi Jinping in the initiative enters the fourth year and is of great importance to global governance and international endeavor to make globalization more inclusive At the heart of China s economic rise is infrastructure connectivity a significant lesson that the Belt and Road forum is expected to promote he opined in his article published in China Daily China needs the Belt and Road projects to seek closer cooperation with the rest of the world and encourage other developing economies to pursue the development paths that suit them best The forum is expected to make that clear by alleviating concerns about China s rise The forum for starters will serve as an opportunity for Beijing to explain why it proposed the transnational programs and how it is going to pursue them The implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to build an inclusive global economy and raise the reciprocal spirit at a time when the tide of globalization is turning in a more protectionist direction because China has not only proposed but also offered constructive plans to help restore its partners confidence in globalization In all likelihood China will accord priority to multilateral negotiations as a missing piece of the puzzle in its promotion of the Belt and Road Initiative which can be sustainable only when transparent cooperative mechanisms are in place The Beijing forum should answer the participants questions about future bilateral and multilateral cooperation and more importantly make institutional concerted efforts to address outstanding concerns of the international community Another mission of the forum is to reiterate China s commitment to building a community of shared destiny by endorsing landmark development proposals in particular the Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris climate change agreement Inspired by the United Nations ambition to achieve shared development through mechanisms such as the Eurasian Land Bridge the Belt and Road Initiative has the potential to help fulfill that goal China has signed memorandums on facilitating Belt and Road projects with the UN Development Programme and the World Health Organization and its grand initiative too has received unequivocal support from the UN which in a resolution last year urged all member states to join it and protect its overseas operation In this context the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation will focus on global economic recovery rebalancing renovation and connectivity As for the future of the Belt and Road Initiative there is still room for its operation which hitherto will be conducted along the industrial chains based on infrastructure The potential of the South American market for instance remains untapped Therefore skeptics of China

the Silk Road Fund and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank Additionally the collapse of the Trans Pacific Partnership provides Beijing with the perfect opportunity to re integrate Asian investment that used to find its way to American banks Further prospects and direction of the B and R initiative will be determined at the two sessions as the project is an integral part of China s new reforms

global think tank sought to dig into the Indian hostility towards the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC and inferred that fear of internationalisation of the Kashmir dispute and the growing

India that China which has been neutral on Kashmir since can no longer be so now that its economic and security interests in these territories are growing in stake Titled as Silk Road Economic Belt considering security implications and the EU China cooperation prospects the report argues that India does not approve of a role for China to mediate in these disputes It should be mentioned here that the think tank report is the first one that elaborately touches upon the topic of Indian concerns on CPEC a subsidiary of One Belt One Road initiative and discussed the mega project s implications on security mechanics in the region The report says India has serious reservations against the CPEC and strictly opposes it The report says Indian sees the CPEC to potentially internationalize the

to be the immense port China envisions it to become China will need to take on a bigger direct or indirect security role it says Unlike India unconcerned Afghanistan is open to all regional initiatives that may reinvigorate its ailing economy whether that is by way of CPEC or India led efforts to connect with the Afghan economy through the Chabahar Port in Iran Likewise Iran has voiced
