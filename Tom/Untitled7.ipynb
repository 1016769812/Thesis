       "'China changes resonate with grassroot Pakistanis The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times Things had improved a lot here noted Asif Jalil a Pakistani businessman and restaurant owner based in Beijing China adding that marks the th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Pakistan and he wishes China to emerge as a beautiful country.It was very lively before Jalil cherished the good old days since he had been here for more than years you could see restaurants had their tables outside with people sitting eating food enjoying beer chatting in the evening almost in every Hutong a narrow lane especially in summer. But this caused some pollution so slowly these things had gone. However he admitted that things and people had improved. Beijing has changed a lot he likes the atmosphere here a city renowned for its ancient opulent palaces temples and huge stone walls and gates. One thing is the physical change. There are more buildings and infrastructures here. It s much more modern than before. At the same time we are seeing big changes in people. People s manners are improving. The way they are operating is much different from the traditional ways when the country was poorer. When they are more like in the third world countries there is a big difference in different segments of society. People lie people steal. Now as economically China becomes better individuals started improving he told China Economic Net CEN . For example throwing garbage or spitting on the roads. If someone tries now mostly older people the youngsters would stare at them and sometimes try to stop them so it s much cleaner now. Also people are talking much politer than before. Their talks are not that rough like it used to be. These changes are also recognized by Muhammad Kamran a Pakistani chef devoting himself to promoting Pakistani cuisine in Chengdu China the country he loves very much.Kamran has been to many countries but he found Chinese people the most loving and friendly. Whenever I am lost in China at bus station or subway I just had to show the name of the intended destination to some Chinese around and they would guided me to the right direction. The first time when I landed at Shanghai airport I didn t know how to find the exit and reach my destination and some Chinese helped me contact my boss and arranged a taxi for me. Living in China for many years he regards China a safe place to enjoy life. When I was in Yiwu I have seen people enjoying nightlife there. You can go out at any time in the evening without any fear. I was afraid at the beginning but later I found there was nothing to worry about and I reckon China as a very safe country and you certainly won t get harassed or robbed here. Muhammad Shahbaz a Pakistani surgeon and PhD scholar at China s Shandong University is impressed by China s poverty alleviation campaign over the past decades.His perception about China was different before. I used to see the Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movies on TV and it was everybody s thought that every Chinese can play Kongfu and every Chinese rides bicycle. Spending more than a decade in China as a medical student he witnessed the rise of China from Beijing Olympics in and he also saw how China help countries along Belt and Road keep better health care opportunities for common people. China not only helped other countries its economy has also boosted.Also he mentioned as the world s second largest economy China has lifted more than million people out of poverty. million is something. Pakistan has a population of around million people if you lift the needy above the poverty line that s a big achievement. I pay my tribute to that and I like the idea of BRI. I hope that China will emerge as a beautiful country not just financially but also culturally Jalil said adding Pakistan and China can cooperate in many many fields and now we have been collaborating already. We are working together. NBBALU eh h Chinese Yuan leading currency in the emerging markets The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times The Chinese currency Yuan is currently seen as the most emerging currency in markets around the world and experts believe that in just a few years it will be one of the most widely used currencies.On November the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund IMF announced inclusion of the Chinese Yuan in the elite basket of currencies called Special Drawing Rights SDR as a fifth currency along with the US Dollar Japanese Yen British Pound and the Euro. The Chinese Yuan also called Renminbi RMB joined the elite basket on October .Shan Saeed Chief Economist at Juwai IQI told China Economic Net that the Chinese Yuan moved very aggressively as most of the countries adopted currency swap with the Chinese government especially with the People s Bank of China PBOC . China s already signed swap agreement with more than currencies especially with Yuan and China is quite keen to launch an internationally Yuan because they believe that Yuan is ready for take off but obviously they want to move Yuan in a very structured manner which is the right approach at this point of time he added. China and Pakistan already signed the Currency Swap Agreement CSA which Pakistan tends to benefit more because Pakistan is one of the biggest recipients of Belt and Road Initiative BRI projects especially China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC which is called the flagship project of BRI. Recently China has done a lot of financial agreements with Pakistan and this has helped Pakistan in maintaining its balance of trade and balance of payment positions Shan stated.He said recently PBOC had given an indication to the market that they wanted to have digital Yuan which was quite acceptable because most of the Chinese did not have paper currency they either used Alipay or WeChat. China is moving ahead at a much faster pace in terms of technology and society in general is becoming cashless where you have countries like Sweden and Singapore which are in the league where more and more consumers are having a cashless transaction Shan said. I think the Chinese Yuan has a huge future. Last year alone if you imagine Chinese Yuan was trading at . against a USD and as of today the Chinese Yuan is trading at . . So it has appreciated more than against USD. It has held strong against the dollar taking into account the exogenous factors he mentioned.Shan said was perhaps one of the first years the global economy had seen because of COVID but the Chinese economy had already recovered and even came out much stronger. China was already recording a trade surplus despite COVID last year.Economist magazine in the latest outlook has mentioned the Chinese economy will achieve a growth rate of . and experts believe that China s growth in will be between to which is perhaps the highest in Asia.

NBBALU eh jChina Pakistan Economic Corridor has huge regional radiation effect Chinese Scholar The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times China and Pakistan are promoting the construction of China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC and if Afghanistan is connected with the corridor it will obtain opportunity of transportation and trade development besides enhancing the regional radiation effect of CPEC. If Afghanistan is connected with the CPEC it will obtain the opportunity of transportation and trade development enhance the regional radiation effect of the CPEC and help CPEC and the whole the Silk Road Economic Belt advance westward said Cheng Xizhong visiting professor at Southwest University of Political Science and Law.Currently Afghanistan mainly relies on Karachi Port for shipping. After the successful construction of Gwadar Port it will become the nearest port to Afghanistan he wrote in his article published by China Economic Net CEN .He observed that Pakistan has already permitted Afghanistan to utilize Gwadar Port and Bin Qasim Port as a goodwill gesture to enhance the bilateral economic ties. The transit trade is also imperative for Central Asian states when it comes to connecting with Gwadar Port in near future.Pakistan and Afghanistan sharing a border of km are geographically adjacent ethnically compatible and religiously identical. They should have been friendly neighbors. However due to historical problems and the infiltration of big powers in this region the relationship between the two countries has been complicated for decades.When visiting Afghanistan on December Prime Minister Imran Khan said that Pakistan supports the inclusive peace process of Afghanistan and will do its best to help Afghanistan achieve peace. This visit has significantly consolidated mutual trust between the two countries.He said that Afghanistan is one of the important countries along the old Silk Road and also one of the regional countries to respond positively to the Belt and Road initiative. Both the government and the people of Afghanistan highly appreciate and warmly look forward to the Belt and Road development.The Afghan government has identified security infrastructure construction the development of private economy agricultural and rural development good governance and human resources development as six priority areas and hopes to fully promote the construction of regional connectivity in the next years so as to make it an important interface connecting Central Asia and South Asia.He pointed out that Afghanistan actively participates in regional economic cooperation organizations including the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation CAREC and Central and South Asia Transport and Trade Forum CSATTF and hopes to promote Afghanistan s integration into regional economic development as soon as possible through cooperation in resource development interconnection and other fields.Cheng said that Adviser to the Prime Minister on Commerce and Investment Abdul Razak Dawood has recently said that a boost in trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan would maximize the chances of regional economic integration and enhance connectivity among neighboring countries. NBBALU eh CPEC Media Forum becomes exchange activity between China Pakistan media Cheng Xizhong The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times In the six years since its establishment the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC Media Forum has become the most influential exchange activity between the media of China and Pakistan the two time honoured oriental nations Cheng Xizhong visiting professor at Southwest University of Political Science and Law said on Tuesday.The th China Pakistan Economic Corridor Media Forum hosted by the Embassy of the People s Republic of China in Pakistan and organized jointly by China Economic Net and Pakistan China Institute was very successfully held he said in his article published by China Economic Net CEN .The th China Pakistan Economic Corridor Media Forum was themed Post pandemic China Pakistan Media Cooperation and conducted in depth exchanges and discussions on the opportunities for digital media media as an engine for the high quality development of CPEC and China Pakistan media cooperation.He said the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC is not only an economic corridor of mutual benefit and win win sharing but also a cultural corridor of people s mutual affinity and telepathy.At a time when the construction of CPEC has attracted much public attention and achieved great progress the exchanges between the two peoples should also be steadily deepened so as to provide strong support for smooth sailing of the giant ship of bilateral cooperation. As a bridge of communication and an important carrier to shape cognition the media has unshakable responsibility and can play a very important role.As for how to give full play to the role of the media I have the following ideas First we should promote media communication through civilization. From a long term perspective and strategic level the media of China and Pakistan should promote exchanges and mutual learning between the two nations with a high degree of cultural self confidence build a bridge between the two civilizations enhance mutual understanding and trust between the two peoples inject new vitality into the traditional friendship between China and Pakistan and jointly make a strong voice of oriental civilization.Second we should promote the establishment of close relations between the two peoples through media communication. The Media plays an irreplaceable role in spreading ideas enhancing understanding and gathering consensus.In recent years China Economic Net has published a large number of key reports which vividly reflect all aspects of Pakistan s economic and social development creating a safe stable and progressive image of Pakistan. Therefore the Chinese people have got a correct and comprehensive understanding of Pakistan.Third we should jointly voice Oriental civilization. The Belt and Road initiative is an important starting point for building a community of shared future for mankind. In this sense the media of China and Pakistan are now engaged in a very great cause. We should understand the media s social responsibility from this height.Let s join hands to tell good Chinese stories good Pakistani stories and good CPEC stories be the disseminators shapers and contributors of the CPEC and be the witnesses recorders and writers of the journey of building a community of shared future for mankind he concluded.

NBBALU egct rPak China media cooperation to help evolve objective narrative of CPEC BRI Ambassador Haque The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times Pakistan Ambassador to China Moin ul Haque on Monday said that enhanced media cooperation between Pakistan and China would help two countries to evolve a correct and objective narrative of China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC and Belt and Road Initiative BRI for both domestic and international audience.It is imperative for media organizations and opinion makers of the two countries to devise a concerted and sustained media strategy to expose ill intentions of adversaries and highlight success and significance of CPEC.He made these remarks while addressing th CPEC Media Forum hosted and organized by the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad China Economic Net and Pakistan China Institute.Ambassador Haque pointed out that despite BRI s universal success and CPEC s visible and tangible dividends for Pakistan some voices in certain countries have taken a highly prejudiced view of CPEC to undermine its accomplishments and obfuscate its future possibilities and expansion. They resort to wishful distortion of facts and fabrication of lies. It is ironical that this propaganda is spearheaded by those who claim to be the flag bearers of economic integration regional connectivity and transparency and openness he added.He proposed that the media houses of the two countries should undertake a fair and objective assessment of BRI and highlight its universal legitimacy and success for spurring economic growth and development in partner countries. And at the same time the discourse on CPEC should particularly bring to fore its concrete and tangible achievements for addressing Pakistan s energy crisis expansion of our development infrastructure and role in socio economic prosperity for people of Pakistan he added.He suggested that media should galvanise public support for bilateral relations educate masses about the historic significance of bilateral friendship and its strategic importance for both countries adding No media strategy is successful without stirring hearts of our peoples to the symphony of friendship. Emphasising a need of expanding bilateral cultural linkages and people to people ties he said that special media campaigns to advance our historical experiences common Asian values and cultural affinities should be initiated.As arts and drama are the best reflection of a nation s philosophy and culture the entertainment industries of two countries should forge strong linkages and promote our dramas movies and music he added.He said there is a lot of interest in forging partnership for screening of Pakistani and Chinese movies in each other countries and also for joint production of films.Ambassador Haque informed that Pakistan and China will be celebrating th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries next year. The next year also marks the centennial of Communist Party of China. So media houses of the two countries should organise special programmes documentaries and seminars to celebrate this important milestone and renew our resolve to take our ties to new heights he added.Appreciating the role of media during the pandemic he said that it not only played a key role in fighting the disease but also assisted the governments to raise awareness about the disease and preventive measures.He remarked that the media cooperation between the two nations has played a historic role to promote the bilateral relations and it is also due to the professionalism and patriotism of our media organizations and journalists that Pakistan China friendship has evolved into Iron Brotherhood and All Weather Ties permeating across all sections of our societies.Pakistan he said is one of the earliest and enthusiastic proponents of President Xi Jinping s Belt and Road Initiative and has emphatically endorsed its philosophy for win win cooperation and regional economic integration.As the pilot project of BRI CPEC stellar success is a testimony of it that Pakistan has now surmounted the chronic energy crisis and laid out a solid infrastructure network for subsequent national development and growth. Phase II of CPEC is now aimed at people centric progress to make it a high quality demonstration project of BRI.He said that two days back the meeting of CPEC Joint Working Group on International Cooperation and Coordination was held in Urumqi. In the meeting it was ensured that CPEC remains an open transparent and inclusive therefore the two countries have decided and agreed to open up CPEC to rd party participation.He said that friendship between Pakistan and China is not merely the result of convergence of bilateral interests but in fact determined by geography history and culture.As Prime Minister Imran Khan said that future of Pakistan and China is co related so the relationship has been sustained by successive governments and generations of people. While our close ties and partnership is a factor of peace and stability it is also a target of our detractors. So our media therefore needs to play a crucial role to help nurture our historic ties educate our peoples promote our stories of friendship and continue advancing new and innovative ideas for achieving our shared destiny. Playing this role successfully would be a great service to our friendship regional stability and most significantly for the prosperity of our peoples he added.

We are confident that with support of the international community China and Pakistan can ensure the success of the CPEC. He said during his regular briefing in response to a question about the threats of disruption of projects being completed under the CPEC framework from the terrorist networks trained and financed by India.He said that the CPEC was not only important for current development of China and Pakistan but also beneficial for the regional connectivity and common prosperity. You mentioned the CPEC. It is an important flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative. It is important for current development of China and Pakistan. It is also beneficial for regional connectivity and common prosperity he said.Zhao said that China also believed that Pakistan would continue to take effective measures to ensure safety and security of the CPEC.While opposing all forms of terrorism he called on the international community and the regional countries to cooperate on fighting terrorism and safeguard collective security.It may be mentioned here that Pakistan recently has shared a dossier with the international community which has incriminating evidence of India harboring training and financing terrorist networks that not only seek to destabilize Pakistan but also the disruption of flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative BRI . NBBALU egbh rPakistan China working on transportation projects under CPEC in Karachi Quetta Ambassador Haque The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times Pakistan and China are discussing and working on many other transportation projects under the framework of China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC in major cities including Karachi capital of Sindh province and Quetta capital of Balochistan.The CPEC in its first phase focuses on infrastructure and energy development referencing Gwadar Port projects in Southwestern Pakistan under the Belt and Road Initiative BRI . The port will enhance connectivity between our two countries and the rest of the world he said in an interview with Global Times.Ambassador Haque said the metro line is an extremely important project under the CPEC that will provide a modern efficient and affordable transport services to the people of Lahore a metropolis of million people with serious traffic congestion.The line will also help reduce carbon emissions and air pollution in the city as more people use it to commute he added.Pakistan s first metro line built by Guangzhou Metro Company opened on October in Lahore. It will be jointly operated by Chinese and Pakistani companies.In the second phase he said the CPEC will mainly concentrate on the areas of agriculture science and technology and vocational training which are very important for Pakistan s poverty alleviation and economic and social development.By learning China s experience we are building a number of special economic zones across the country which will provide opportunities for investors from China and other countries he said.Ambassador Haque noted that Pakistan and China have a long history of interaction and people to people exchanges helping foster their relationship and mutual understanding in a variety of cultural sectors.The two neighbours are getting closer than ever from arts and culture infrastructure and poverty alleviation to cooperation in regional security he added.While commenting release of Parwaaz Hai Junoon the first Pakistani film which hit Chinese mainland theatres in decades he said that he expects the movie to be warmly welcomed by Chinese audiences.It is one of the most popular and highest grossing movies to be made in Pakistan which had done very well in box office in Pakistan and across the world he said.

So this movie will be a trailblazer and a starting point for such a cooperation. Ambassador Haque said there is a long history of interactions between people living in China and Pakistan. So after our two countries became independent this history and cultural affinity brought them closer and closer to each other he said mentioning the two sides signed their first cultural cooperation agreement in .Since then we had numerous events between Pakistan and China in the fields of art festivals sports literature and music. We have also established a number of sister cities and sister provinces between the two sides he added.

NBBALU egbg yPakistan hopes for balanced approach from Biden towards New Delhi Islamabad Munir Akram The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times Pakistan s Ambassador to the United Nations Munir Akram has expressed the hope that United States under the leadership of President elect Joe Biden would adopt a balanced approach towards India and Pakistan and help prevent an all out confrontation that threatens the region. We hope that as in the past the U.S. would adopt a balanced approach towards both India and Pakistan an approach that is equitable that takes into account the national interests of not only India but also Pakistan he said in an wide ranging interview with Newsweek. If that is the case if there is a balanced policy from Washington towards the continent I think Washington would find Pakistan a willing partner Ambassador Akram added. Obviously Pakistan would like to have better relations with the United States and we would be looking to find the areas of convergence where we can work together with the U.S. he told Newsweek correspondent Tom O Conner.Akram called the U.S. India strategic partnership a wrong choice but added nevertheless that s the U.S. choice. Still he argued that improving ties with Pakistan could prove extremely beneficial for the upcoming administration.Correspondent O Connor wrote that Washington s tilt toward New Delhi also occurred as nuclear armed India and Pakistan experienced some of their worst tensions in decades over their decades old Kashmir dispute. India removed the special status of the disputed state in August last year which was followed by a severe lockdown that saw Indian troops committing human rights abuses against protesting Kashmiri people.In the interview Akram hoped that based upon his past statements Biden as president would be willing to address these issues with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In doing so the Pakistani envoy said the president elect could help prevent an all out confrontation that threatens the region. We hope that with this approach of adherence to the principles of human rights and opposition to repression and all that goes with it Akram said that we will find common ground with the U.S. to help us to defuse the situation in Kashmir to help us in avoiding the danger of a conflict with our big neighbour India.While the Trump administration s reactions to the human rights abuses in India administered Kashmir were muted there are indications that the Biden administration may adopt a more assertive stance according to the Newsweek report.Biden s running mate former Senator Kamala Harris whose mother was born in India issued a statement during her campaign that We have to remind Kashmiris that they are not alone in the world. She indicated a willingness to get involved directly if necessary. There is a need to intervene if the situation demands she said.Biden s foreign policy adviser Anthony Blinken also brought up Kashmir during a July talk hosted by the Hudson Institute the report pointed out. We obviously have challenges now and real concerns for example about some of the actions that the government has taken Blinken said at the time particularly in cracking down on freedom of movement and freedom of speech in Kashmir some of the laws on citizenship. Blinken emphasized the importance of diplomacy. But you re always better engaging with a partner he said and a vitally important one like India. Akram in his comments during the interview hoped this translates into political action. Hopefully if the Biden administration is open to looking at the reality of the Jammu and Kashmir situation and what the Indians are doing there he told Newsweek that it will come to the conclusion that it is important to achieve a political solution as well. While Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has yet to bring up the Kashmir dispute in public correspondences with the upcoming administration it s likely to be at the center of future contacts between the two leaders Newsweek said.In the context of Sino Indian tensions Newsweek report said the Trump administration s shoring up of regional ties has not been limited to India noting that the U.S. has reinvigorated the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue QUAD in recent years bringing together Australia and Japan in a bid to pursue a vision of a free and open Indo Pacific .Such coalition building has angered Beijing whose embassy in Washington accused US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last month of reckless smearing and groundless accusations .But Ambassador Akram told Newsweek that Pakistan is not alarmed by these developments. The QUAD is not a direct concern for us he said because we are not in competition for regional or global power. We have no pretensions to be a major power. He explained that he understood why the US would want to court a market as big as India s but that Pakistan was seeking assurances that the Washington New Delhi relationship would not come at Islamabad s expense. We would like to be obviously reassured that such capabilities which are being shared with India are not going to be used against Pakistan he said and that they would not compromise Pakistan s national security interests. And of course how Pakistan s national interests and how non security interests would be protected. Newsweek quoted a State Department spokesperson as saying Our relationship with Pakistan stands on its own merits as does our relationship with India. We do not view our relationships in the region as zero sum. On his part the Pakistani envoy said that Islamabad s first priority is development and that the Trump administration s protectionist approach in attempting to counter Chinese President Xi Jinping s Belt and Road Initiative of intercontinental infrastructure projects and investment has been met with a cold reception in Pakistan.Ambassador Akram suggested there is a real opportunity for expansion of US Pakistan relationship. Whereas China may have an advantage vis a vis investment in physical infrastructure at the moment the United States has an advantage in investing in human infrastructure aside he said. There is a potential partnership we would be looking at with an administration that is open to such cooperation with Pakistan. This attitude he hoped would be extended globally as well reversing the Trump administration s unilateral exit from international agreements and institutions. From what we see the Biden administration would wish to re engage with the international community the Pakistani envoy said to re engage at the multilateral level with international organizations in order to resolve issues like climate change to achieve more equitable development in the world to address human rights non proliferation. He said that these issues require working not only with partners but also with rivals such as China. If this is to be promoted there is so much more that could be done when the United States and China are working if not together but at least in tandem in the same direction Akram said. If multilateralism does imbue the policies of the Biden ministration this would lead to some reduction in tensions resumption in cooperation at the international level and I think that would be good for everybody in the world. NBBALU egbf qCIIE to promote Pakistan s exports to China Ambassador Haque The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times Pakistan Ambassador to China Moin ul Haque said that China International Import Expo CIIE is the flagship event of China and it fully supports the exports of Pakistan s products here.Ambassador Haque said that he was extremely happy to represent Pakistan in the third China International Import Expo CIIE in Shanghai.

NBBALU egbb uChina Pakistan friendship nurtured a forest in desert of Gawadar Global Times The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times During the COVID pandemic lockdown the Chinese port operator at Pakistan s southwest Port of Gwadar focused its attention on forest planting and has now successfully completed a friendship forest in a city situated in a desert climate gifting the city its first ever green park.At the foot of the area s Koh e Batil Hill the forest spreads across mu hectares of land provided by the Pakistani government for free. The construction of the park was supported by the local community and the Pakistani Navy which promptly relocated its camps and buildings in just two weeks to evacuate the land needed for forest planting according to an article published by Global Times.Located in Pakistan s southwest province of Balochistan Gwadar Port is a key project of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC a flagship project of the China proposed Belt and Road Initiative BRI . Since its operation the port has begun to play a new role as an economical transit stop and time saving trade port for land locked Afghanistan when it ships fertilizer.To build a forest in Gwadar s desert climate with almost no rain is no easy task and the China Overseas Ports Holding Company the port s operator joined hands with the city government of Puyang in Central China s Henan Province to work toward the target of affording the local community a green park in as short a time as possible that would have low maintenance costs and be easily accessible.The most advanced irrigation technology is applied here a manager of the forest park s builder said noting that the building of the forest received on site guidance by a team of Chinese agriculture experts.A total of trees shrubs and flowers that resist high temperature high saline alkali soils were planted with a meter long irrigation pipeline system and a storage tanker holding up to cubic meters of water according to the company. It takes us about months to complete the friendship forest roughly coinciding with the time period of the pandemic and we are continuing work to improve the park and the forest Zhang Baozhong chairman of China Overseas Ports Holding Company told the Global Times.The fact that a forest of this size can be added to the extremely hot and dry land of Gwadar in such a short time shows how much importance China s BRI builders attach to the concept of green development a concept also specifically implemented in China to help work toward a sustainable ecological civilization analysts pointed out.Xu Liping director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing told the Global Times on Monday that while infrastructure building lies at the core of the BRI development the green aspects of BRI development also began to achieve tangible results in recent years. The new feature is an important accent of BRI s sustainable approach toward development. Such a development approach is in accordance with UN s development goals and that of the BRI s. It marks the fact that BRI development has entered a high quality development phase Xu added.

The projects completed under CPEC are part of The Belt and Road.Shipping cargo started at Gwadar port during the first six months of this year. Up to tons of goods were delivered from shipping cargo to Afghanistan. Employment opportunities were also created through shipping. There is no doubt that these projects have improved infrastructure as well as energy supply and employment opportunities.According to economist Hollis B. Channery s proposed two gap model developing countries need to introduce foreign investment and stimulate exports to boost their national economies. In this regard CPEC has been instrumental in advancing Pakistan s development.The CPEC has addressed the issue of limited investment potential. Inadequate savings and shortage of foreign exchange in Pakistan and provided a high quality axis for Pakistan s economic growth. Pakistan s GDP growth rate is significant and it has created jobs in Pakistan.Since its inception CPEC has considered the elimination of energy shortages in Pakistan as an important sector of construction. Over a five year period energy projects under the CPEC framework added MW of electricity to Pakistan by early April accounting for of the country s installed capacity.The shortage of electricity has been greatly reduced and in addition to power generation projects China built the Matiari Lahore an km long kV HVDC transmission line project in Pakistan the world s second HVDC transmission line to extend the life of Pakistan s power grid.The construction of CPEC is progressing rapidly significantly reducing Pakistan s energy problem and improving transportation infrastructure has laid a foundation for Pakistan s industrial development.In the next phase industrial cooperation is the focus of CPEC s construction and development.

NBBALU egb Matiari Lahore project equivalent to main artery of North South transmission power grid Chief Engineer The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times Matiari Lahore direct current transmission line project is equivalent to the main artery of Pakistan s North South transmission power grid China Power Equipment Corporation s third business Chief Engineer Chang Yong said. Previously Pakistan had only AC power transmission projects. In terms of long distance large capacity power transmission compared with AC transmission DC transmission projects have the advantages of small loss long transmission distance and higher economy he told CRI Online.He said that the transmission power could account for about one sixth of Pakistan s entire grid which will provide strong support for the local future development.According to CRI Online the Matiari Lahore kV direct current transmission line project a key project of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor has been completed.With the completion of the no load compression open circuit OLT test for the DC bipolar in Lahore converter Station the live DC field of kV was successfully completed marking the historic highest voltage level of Pakistan s national grid reached kV.As the only power transmission and transformation project under the Priority Implementation project list of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor the Matiari Lahore DC project is an important measure taken by the State Grid Co. Ltd. to serve the Belt and Road construction and is an important part of the international engineering construction field to prevent the epidemic. The results are also a new opportunity to promote the internationalization of power standards according to a report of CRI Online.The Matiari Lahore is Pakistan s first DC transmission project. It is currently the project with the highest voltage level and the longest transmission line in Pakistan. It is the first kV DC project with fully independent intellectual property rights in the world by the State Grid Corporation of China.The only power grid project in the Pakistan Economic Corridor Energy Cooperation Agreement. After the project is put into operation it will effectively alleviate the power shortage in Punjab Province Pakistan s most important economic center and the capital Islamabad greatly promote Pakistan s economic development improve people s living standards and contribute to the deepening of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor and the promotion of China Pakistan energy cooperation. It is of great significance.The project has a total investment of US . billion and started construction on December .

Conceptualized by the KP Economic Zone Development and Management Company KPEZDMC Rashakai SEZ is a flagship project of the KP Government that would be established on acres land with collaboration of China on Peshawar Islamabad Motorway M in Nowshera district. The acres land of Rashakai SEZ would be developed in three phases.

It will create around job opportunities and will bring different industries that can do import substitution and bring new technologies he told.Daud mentioned this project is within the umbrella of CPEC and Belt and Road Initiative BRI . This is the first special economic zone that is being developed in a public private partnership. if this experiment proves to be fruitful I think many similar special economic zones will follow.The other important aspect is the location of the special economic zone that is near to Peshawar and also not too far from the Pak Afghan Torkham border he added.Regarding the question about what kind of incentive Chinese investors would get Daud told there are many incentives under the framework of CPEC Special Economic Zone Act that stipulates industry that is set up in any special economic zones under CPEC would get tax relief for years on import duty and also on income tax for a similar period.He said that for the developer there is an exemption on import of development equipment for one time so that they can develop the special economic zone on modern lines. Besides this the government offers special security for foreign investors.

I also see some heavy industry like steel coming this way because there is a growing demand for construction equipment and material as the Pakistani Prime Minister initiative on the construction sector. The Agro industry which is eco friendly will be extremely welcomed he expressed.Butt said that Rashakai Special Economic Zone will be developed in three phases in the first phase the infrastructure and road network will be developed and also the industries can start the development after the bidding process. The first phase would be completed in less than two years. The second phase will largely be about expansion and looking at modern trends and inviting new technologies. The last phase will again be about the expansion of this SEZ. Initially Rashakai SEZ would cover about Acre land and will be increased to Acre after the completion of all phases.After the merger of Federally Administered Tribal Areas FATA With Khyber Pakhtunkhwa KPK province more and more youngsters are now getting a higher education and employed in not just from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but in entire Pakistan. I see a lot of commerce and economic activity happening in North Waziristan and South Waziristan Daud stated. The people from FATA will naturally become the employment pool for this special economic zone because they are extremely hardworking extremely talented and they have the historic knack of economic and trade activities. So I think they will be easily employed in this SEZ besides this SEZ we are also working on People from FATA will naturally become the employment pool for this special economic zone because they are extremely hardworking extremely talented and they have the historic knack of economic and trade activities. So I think they will be easily employed in this SEZ under the framework of CPEC and there could also be a stimulus for the economic growth of the region he further said.Daud mentioned that many Chinese investors have shown interest to invest in this special economic zone because they are aware of the importance of the location and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa KPK as a place which is called a land of growing opportunity for local and particularly foreign investors.Daud mentioned that many Chinese investors have shown interest to invest in this special economic zone because they are aware of the importance of the location and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa KPK as a place which is called a land of growing opportunities for local and particularly foreign investors.

Such unilateral measures run counter to our shared objective of creating a regional environment of amity and cooperation and these must be opposed resolutely Qureshi remarked.He reiterated that while supporting no military solution to the Afghan conflict Pakistan believed the Afghan stakeholders must seize this historic opportunity of US Taliban agreement and work together to secure an inclusive broad based and comprehensive political settlement. At the same time it is imperative to be cognizant of the role of spoilers within and outside who do not want peace and stability to return to Afghanistan. The intra Afghan negotiations process will not be without challenges he added.He suggested that the return of Afghan refugees to their homeland with dignity and honour should be an essential part of the peace negotiations.He said that while tackling terrorism and extremism continues to be one of SCO s highest priorities the member states must not allow any country to use terrorism related allegations as a political tool to malign and victimize any country religion or race. We must also condemn and hold accountable the perpetrators of State terrorism against people under illegal occupation in disputed territories he remarked.He believed that discussions in SCO on prevention of arms race in outer space Biological Weapons Convention BWC and ensuring International Information Security would enrich the debate for having a unified stance on these issues. NBBALU eg b mDigital trade a potential area for Pakistan China cooperation DCM The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times There is immense potential for digital trade between Pakistan and China as the former is actually moving towards digitalization and the China International Fair for Trade in Service CIFTIS provides an opportunity for the BRI countries to really look into the prospect said Deputy Chief of Mission DCM of Pakistan to China Ahmed Farooq.CIFTIS held from September to is the largest comprehensive exhibition in the field of global trade in services in China. The event organized under the background of global economic recovery is meant to provide opportunities for international businesses together online and offline and facilitate cooperation.Addressing at a session of Belt and Road Digital Trade under the fair Ahmed said the CIFTIS is conducive to restoring economic vitality improving trade connectivity and facilitating the development of digital trade in the region.Highlighting digital development in Pakistan Ahmed told China Economic Net CEN it holds a bright future especially in the post pandemic era when offline business is undermined and online becomes the trend.The size of the population is very critical to digitalization as well. Pakistan is a country with million people and around two thirds of the population is below years old an energetic group always interested in new things and more adaptable to transformation.The society as a whole is also taking incremental steps to accept those changes brought about by digitalization including e commerce digital payment online education etc.Besides the government is also keen on promoting the Digital Pakistan policy in view of millions of new jobs expected to be created from economic growth due to digitalization.Pakistan also has immense potential for developing tourism. With the potential of China s outbound tourism and the special bond between Pakistan and China there will be plenty of cooperation opportunities between the two countries after the epidemic Ahmed said. Blessed with diversified geography from snow clad mountains to deserts to the uncharted sea Pakistan is home to peaks above meters as well as more than a km long serene coastline with sandy and sunny beaches.Pakistan is honored with historical sites of Indus Valley civilization that can trace back to years ago and preserves hundreds of Buddhist heritage sites. Be it digitalization of Pakistan or tourism CPEC will continue to play a part in driving their development as it did in the infrastructure sector Ahmed noted.CPEC is moving towards the second phase with a human centric approach and the areas of food security vocational training job creation and health sector and others are expected to improve the well being of the people. NBBALU eg b Ambassador Haque invites Chinese entrepreneurs to take advantage of the dividend of SEZs in Pakistan The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times Pakistan Ambassador to China Moin ul Haque has invited Chinese businessmen to take advantage of the dividend of Special Economic Zones SEZs set up under China Pakistan Economic Corridor CPEC in Pakistan. Under CPEC we have identified nine special economic zones across Pakistan and three of them are now in advanced stage of preparation. So through this I take this opportunity to invite my Chinese friends and businessmen to come and take advantage of these special economic zones in Pakistan. We are going to share all the details very soon he said in an interview with Economic Daily China Economic Net CEN published on Thursday.Pakistan has been committed to building industrial clusters in recent years to improve its ability to undertake the relocation of Chinese industries. Chinese companies have also been paying continuous attention to the implementation of preferential policies in Pakistan s special economic zones.In this regard Haque said We have learned a lot from the Chinese experience of developing special economic zones. Ambassador Haque said the tariff reduction arrangements for the Phase II of China Pakistan Free Trade Agreement CPFTA were officially implemented on January this year.Talking about China Pakistan trade relations during COVID pandemic he pointed out First of all we are very happy that China has posted a very positive and more than growth in the second quarter. Despite the pandemic the first quarter of this year we saw our bilateral trade increase. In this second quarter there was a little dip because of the disruption of the international travel. The updated FTA is very important. Over items are now enjoying duty free access to each other countries including fisheries and pharmaceuticals. So there are many opportunities for the traders of the two countries to work in this area. We hope that in the months and years to come our trade will increase from our previous figures. Talking about his experience in the first month of his new duty Ambassador Haque first mentioned the second strategic dialogue between China and Pakistan which was held in August in south China s Hainan Province. It was a very very important meeting after the visit of President of Pakistan to China in March. While thanking China for its very valuable support to us during the pandemic Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi appreciated the announcement made by Chinese President Xi Jinping that whenever a vaccine is developed it would be considered a public good. And it should be accessible to all countries especially the developing countries he added.Regarding ML railway a multiplier effect for the Phase II of CPEC he said The spectrum of Pakistan China relationship is very broad and very deep adding We cooperate in all areas from defense to security from trade to investment culture education science and technology agriculture and tourism. CPEC is a very important element of our relationship. It s a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative. And one of our focuses will be to see that all projects the ongoing projects and those of which have been conceived in the early harvest and the first phase are completed on time. The industrial development cooperation of the phase two is also in sync with the social economic development agenda of our current government. So these will be very important areas that I ll be working on during my term he said.Ambassador Hashmi said Diamer Bhasha Dam is also as part of the Prime Minister Imran Khan s vision to provide a clean and an affordable energy to our country. And we are very grateful to Chinese companies for taking a lead in the construction of this dam. ML is the largest project on the CPEC. It is a very important project for both Pakistan and China. It will help to provide very economical and efficient inland travel in Pakistan. I think it will also be very important as a multiplier effect for the phase II of CPEC he added.After fully expressing the necessity of agricultural modernization Ambassador Haque introduced Pakistan s industry and service industry. Like China and many other countries our work and life were also affected by the COVID . There were new ideas new concepts and new products. In Pakistan we started making our own masks testing kits and ventilators. It can be part of the health corridor that we are talking about and we support the China proposed initiative to create a health corridor.The pharmaceutical industry in Pakistan is very strong and our surgical goods are one of the best in the world. Besides vaccines we can produce other medicines and health equipment to promote cooperation he said.Ambassador Haque said Another area which I would like to mention is automobile industry. China and Pakistan are working together to make new brand automobiles. Many Pakistani fashion products are very popular in the world. Our IT applications are very popular. A company like NetSol has a sizable business in China. Pakistan is the rd or th largest country in milk production. We are making new investments in value added products such as cheese butter yogurt and others. We hope that more Chinese investors can come to Pakistan in this field. According to Ambassador Haque s Twitter account information he used to work in Belgium Canada France Sri Lanka Turkey and the United States before he assumed the charge of new Ambassador of Pakistan to China. While answering various economic questions raised by the reporter he shared his views on the learning curve and economic diplomacy. Slowly and steadily Pakistani enterprises are reaching to the stage that they can brand and market the products. Our pharmaceutical company Martin Dow set up two manufacturing plants in France. In a country like France it s very important for Pakistani companies to go internationally and promote Pakistani products and brands. We are learning also it is a learning curve for Pakistani businessmen he said. The economic relationship between China and Pakistan has always been very important. Like diplomacy has changed from traditional diplomacy to economic diplomacy I think you play a very important role not only in producing news items and information but also in bringing the two countries together in the fields of culture and economy. Pakistan has beautiful landscapes and a very rich history. We d like more and more Chinese tourists to go to Pakistan and see for themselves the beauty and diversity of Pakistan he added. Pakistan and China have very special ties. It s a relationship between two friends between two partners between two brothers. No wonder that we call each other Iron Brothers Ambassador Haque started like this when he accepted the interview.During a special period and in a special way Ambassador Haque began his new position in China. After a year tenure of Pakistan s Ambassador to France Haque left from Paris and arrived in Beijing on the night of July and then self quarantined for days. It s a great honor for me to be appointed Pakistani Ambassador to China. It will be my sincere endeavor with my wonderful team that I have at the embassy to contribute to this very important partnership and take it into the New Era he said.

NBBALU eg gAt UNGA India breaks ranks with developing countries to back failed Western anti China move The Balochistan TimesNBBALU c The Balochistan Times A move by Western nations and their supporters including India seeking to delete from two UN General Assembly resolutions an endorsement of win win cooperation concept of global economic development that is associated with China failed at the member body s first in person meeting since March.The term win win cooperation was part of the resolutions New Partnership for Africa s Development NEPAD and Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa under which the Assembly called for implementing the international community s commitments for Africa s economic and social development as well as national reconciliation transitional justice and social and economic recovery in countries emerging from conflict.The resolutions were introduced by the representative of Guyana on behalf of the Group of developing countries and China.The attempt to remove the win win cooperation phrase was defeated by an overwhelming vote of to NEPAD and to Causes of conflict in Africa .In a speech last year at a summit in Beijing on China s Belt and Road initiative President Xi Jinping said the mega project was aimed at advancing win win cooperation among countries and build a new platform for international trade. He said the next step in recreating the old Silk Road was to push the initiative toward high quality development with a focus on green infrastructure and finance.Western governments have claimed that the initiative was a means to spread Chinese influence abroad saddling poor countries with unsustainable debt.At the UN in a break from the common position of the developing countries India sided with the Western block in opposing the win win cooperation language. The Indian representative claimed that they were not sure who is winning and said the concept was germane to a particular member state and to its political leadership .Earlier Germany s representative presented the amendment which was later defeated on behalf of the European Union to delete the paragraph from the resolutions containing win win formulation concept which he said focused on economic gains at the expense of sustainable development needs. He added that the term was undefined and not internationally agreed to.In his response China s delegate said win win cooperation was an essential requirement for common development as well as an important means for advancing multilateralism. Other countries however were putting their own interests first and politicizing development issues thus putting a drag on global economic recovery and growth he said.The resolutions paragraph in question reads The Assembly Also reiterates that we are setting out together on the path towards sustainable development devoting ourselves collectively to the pursuit of global development and of win win cooperation which can bring huge gains to all countries and all parts of the world. Both resolutions were subsequently adopted by the General Assembly with the support of over countries.After the India backed Western attempt to delete the phrase failed India voted for the resolution while disassociating itself from the language on win win cooperation in the resolutions.Diplomats say the India s attempt to balance itself between its closer proximity to the West and its purported leadership claim of the developing countries is increasingly exposing deep contradictions in New Delhi s position.The Assembly met on September and after UN Headquarters in New York partially open for business from a shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
