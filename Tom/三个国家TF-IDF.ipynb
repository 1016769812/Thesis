Than M in NIH Funding for COVID Research words July New grants study immune system response and build on nearly a dozen other COVID research projects underway at the Institution SEATTLE July ewswire Today the Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason BRI announced four new COVID research grants and updates related to existing COVID research happening at the Institution that totals more than million dollars funded by the National Institutes of Health NIH The new grants like BRI s other COVID research leverage BRI s expertise in the immune system and its intersection with disease which is central to understanding COVID not just whether a person becomes infected but also the severity of the infection and how it resolves One study is part of a larger national effort and examines the immune responses in people hospitalized with COVID to uncover markers that may predict a more severe infection and for those recovering more insights into an effective immune response another looks at the site of COVID infection in lung tissue to identify ways to interrupt slow or stop the infection one studies an overactive inflammatory immune response that occurs in some very severe cases and the fourth studies two strains of the virus circulating locally in Seattle and how each may lead to different immune responses and disease severity I am proud of BRI s rapid response to researching COVID said BRI President Jane Buckner MD Our vision is for a healthy immune system for every individual As part of that work we lend our immunology expertise and tools to help uncover answers to the COVID puzzle why some people experience a more severe infection to what underlying factors may dictate a worse infection These new grants build upon a dozen other COVID research efforts happening at BRI a testament to BRI s agile infrastructure and strong clinical connections with Virginia Mason Health System which allow it to quickly translate work from the lab to the clinic For example more than Virginia Mason team members and BRI researchers are collaborating to study patient blood samples expediting multi year processes and regulations to just a matter of weeks The research teams at BRI are hopeful that their quick collaborative work can yield new pathways for clinical solutions This announcement follows a surprising BRI discovery recently published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology that found individuals with asthma and allergies were less susceptible to the virus infection Details for each new NIH funded COVID grant include Examining Immune Responses in People Hospitalized with COVID Jane Buckner MD This research is part of a larger national project involving institutions that aims to track the immune responses of people hospitalized with COVID called the COVID Immunophenotyping Study IMPACC by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Jane Buckner MD is the principal investigator overseeing a team at BRI that is performing RNA sequencing on an anticipated upper respiratory samples to identify biomarkers of COVID disease progression and help identify novel therapeutics to treating it The BRI team will work with the other study sites around the U S to analyze and integrate all the data sets generated through this project Team members working on this grant include Matt Altman MD MPhil Scott Presnell PhD Charlie Quinn Vivian Gersuk PhD and the Genomics Core and Bernard Khor MD PhD The study is months long Studying Two Strains of COVID and the Cellular Immune Response in People with Varying Levels of Disease William Kwok PhD There is almost no data yet on the human cellular response to the virus so BRI researchers will examine cellular immune responses in people with different levels of disease symptoms from mild to severe The BRI team will look at the two major strains of SARS CoV circulating in the Seattle area and evaluate whether these strains lead to different immune responses and disease severity Understanding aberrant immune responses in the severe disease group should enable us to design appropriate approaches for treatment William Kwok PhD is the principal investigator on the study that has recently been granted million by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health The team includes Erik Wambre PhD Peter Linsley PhD Carmen Mikacenic MD and Virginia Mason s Uma Malhotra MD Understanding the COVID Infection in Lung Tissue Steve Ziegler PhD This month grant helps BRI look at the response of the lung s epithelial cells the barrier where COVID infection occurs and where the virus replicates Led by Steven Ziegler PhD using a model system referred to as a lung in a dish his team will closely examine how immune cells respond to the virus and to infected epithelial cells This can lead to an understanding of how the virus gets into the cells and potential pathways or genes that can be manipulated to help resist the infection from occurring or replicating The team includes Adam Lacy Hulbert PhD Jessica Hamerman PhD and Daniel Campbell PhD as well as Seattle Children s Research Institute s Jason Debley MD MPH Exploring Cytokine Storm in COVID Jessica Hamerman PhD This month research effort will look at an inflammatory syndrome called cytokine storm that occurs in some people with severe COVID The BRI team seeks to identify if cytokine storm in COVID patients is similar to the inflammatory disorder secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis HLH and to discover if markers of HLH can identify patients early during disease who may benefit from particular therapies Other investigators include Virginia Mason s Uma Malhotra MD and Carmen Mikacenic MD who will be joining BRI s faculty in July There are a dozen other COVID research projects happening at BRI including How COVID Impacts the Immune System Differently in People Through this ongoing partnership with Virginia Mason BRI is studying blood samples from patients infected with COVID to explore what predicts whether someone will have a good or poor outcome In a later phase of the project the team will look at people who have recovered from COVID and are still susceptible or protected from future bouts of infection The lead investigators include BRI s Jane Buckner MD Cate Speake PhD and Virginia Mason s Uma Malhotra MD and team members across both institutions For more information on BRI and its research efforts visit About Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason BRI works to advance the

applying for a Paycheck Protection Program PPP loan Some applicants never received a response from their bankers others struggled to submit paperwork in time due to lack of assistance However Meenu Sandhu a southern California entrepreneur was astonished that TMC Financing was able to respond to her inquiries help her through the application process and approve her loans so quickly TMC Financing a commercial real estate lender originally helped Meenu acquire property for her business via the SBA Program in As a current client Meenu was invited to apply for a PPP loan from TMC Although she was feeling defeated from her PPP experience with her bank in a last ditch effort she decided to give it a go with TMC Here is how the story unfolded in her own words Dear TMC Financing I write to you amidst the chaos of PPP loan applications to share a very positive experience I have several companies a true small business owner The amount of frustration and uncertainty I faced in the last few weeks is unjustifiable I applied for a PPP loan with a major bank the day the program was released Yet I had to sit and wait with no response no hope It felt like my application was submitted into a deep black hole Despite several attempts I couldn t get anyone to answer the phone or reply to my emails I didn t know if I was missing paperwork or if I correctly interpreted the SBA PPP guidelines I even called my business banker who had no time for me I felt like I was begging for attention In addition I was told to avoid submitting duplicate applications to other lenders I felt loyal to my bank and our longstanding relationship so I stood by and continued to wait Then I learned that the very bank I trusted helped larger companies first and ran out of funding before I could get approved I felt so ignorant and helpless with no one to turn to After talking to a dozen business owners I found the courage to apply again through a different bank This time I received loan documents and for a moment I was excited However my optimism did not last long I never received further confirmation I found myself right back where I was during my initial attempt worried and hopeless Then to my surprise I get an email on Friday April th at pm from a trusted TMC Financing TMC helped me with my very first SBA loan so I was thrilled to learn that you were accepting PPP applications I mustered enough strength to apply ONE MORE TIME Once I submitted my application I emailed TMC s PPP team asking if anything was missing I thought perhaps they might be nice enough to care and provide a response Suddenly I get an email at pm on Saturday night The email confirmed that TMC will be reviewing my application and included an approximate timeline for loan approval My first thought was wow someone is actually responding on the weekend I was so appreciative It is now Sunday I am worried because many news outlets reported that PPP funding was expected to run out as early as Monday I remember thinking oh no I am too late In desperation I emailed TMC never expecting that I would get a reply I asked if I could apply for more PPP loans to help my other companies To my surprise I received confirmation and I quickly submitted the necessary documents right away The very next day I was able to call TMC and talk to a live person The experience was overwhelmingly beautiful professional and helpful in every aspect I want to THANK TMC and people like Hunter Secrest Grace Bri Staci Kurt the lady that answers the phone and the woman who responded to my very first issue on Friday at pm Amanda Near TMC s professionalism and consistent follow through helped me secure the funding I needed to pay my staff during this difficult time I couldn t be more grateful Kind Regards Meenu Sandhu Through PPP funding Meenu was able to continue to provide paychecks to staff employed at her gas stations convenient stores and even her newly founded educational non profit Science Academy For All Thank you Meenu for writing such a gracious letter We are so glad TMC could support you as well as many other local small businesses during this time of crisis TMC Financing Document

and Export Analysis published by China Building Ceramics Sanitaryware Association shows that both volume and value of ceramic tiles export from China to developed countries and regions including Europe U S and Japan decreased year by year while the export to ASEAN Africa and other Belt and Road countries is increasing year by year The coronavirus outbreak is having an impact on the global economy but as work and production resume domestic consumption needs will rebound Manufacturers are facing challenges with coronavirus Global trade growth has slowed down since China export of building ceramics and sanitaryware continued to grow and in the meanwhile the product quality has been improved Total amount of ceramics and sanitaryware export including bathroom hardware accessories reached billion up by YOY Due to the evolving situation related to the global spread of COVID China imports and exports of building ceramics and sanitaryware products experienced unprecedented challenges Distributors will be replaced by construction projects to become the main sales channel of ceramic tiles In the face of complicated and severe international trade and economic climate heavy reliance on distributors is dangerous for manufacturers With the full recovery of domestic market construction projects probably will displace traditional dealers and become the most important sales channel to sell ceramic tiles Data shows that in the total sales volume of national TOP real estate developers reached trillion RMB while the overall amount of TOP was over trillion RMB Chinese authorities issued a policy in recent years that newly built commercial residential buildings must be finely finished before deliver to buyers Supported by the ongoing policy there is a huge potential in the strategic centralized procurement of finely finished real estate projects which the market value estimated nearly billion RMB Based on the reality many large scale ceramic manufacturers began to fully prepare for the fierce market competition However it is predicted that a large amount of companies who are less competitive lack of brand value or weak in management will be eliminated due to the high entry barrier accelerating the industry reshuffle and brand concentration Seize the market of commercial construction projects by brand exposure and match making at Hotel Plus HDE Serving as

level free trade port Hainan the southernmost island province of China has been attracting people from around the world for years with its blue waters towering coconut trees year round sunshine and

highest level of openness in the world Overseas products and funds will have free access within the port and the majority of goods will be exempt from tariffs This move reflects China s determination to further open up to the rest of the world Thirty two years ago the Chinese government established the province of Hainan on what was then a closed off and underdeveloped border island It was later designated as a special economic zone SEZ to attract foreign investment with its preferential tax rates and favorable business environment In Hainan established the Yangpu Economic Development Zone the first zone in China to be comprehensively developed by foreign investors Eight years later in Hainan took the lead to implement a policy of visas on arrival The following year the town of Boao in Hainan became the permanent venue for the annual Boao Forum for A series of initiatives like these have allowed Hainan to continue developing Establishing special economic zones was also a breakthrough in China s opening up Back in Hainan created a pilot zone for free trade on the island Two years later it began to explore and establish a free trade port with Chinese characteristics meaning greater freedom in finance investment and the flow of talents The essence of the port goes beyond trade or favorable policies it creates a truly open environment at the highest level in terms of the governance system legal institutions and technological innovation amongst others Hainan is blessed with a picturesque landscape Its industrial structure focused around tourism and modern services will not only become an advantage and characteristic for the Hainan Free Trade Port but also coincide with the rapid trade growth in global services and are in line with the development of many ports toward the service sector Besides as a provincial level SEZ a free trade zone and a port Hainan enjoys its scale It also has comprehensive experience and has made such institutional innovations as province wide one stop business registration and an integrated big data society governance system All these factors will enable Hainan to become a global center for the trade in services Meanwhile as a pivot of the Belt and Road Initiative the Hainan Free Trade Port will not only promote multilateral free trade and regional economic integration but also share the benefits brought from China s development with more countries Hainan s evolution from special economic zone to free trade pilot zone and now today s free trade port not only bears witness to its development but also the continual opening up of China as well as its determination to build an open global economy featuring innovation and inclusiveness Hopefully in the future more companies and talented

Infrastructure Summary This report provides a detailed analysis of China s involvement in global infrastructure Read the full report With its Belt and Road Initiative BRI which is now thought to cover countries China has demonstrated its intention to increase its influence on global infrastructure development and at the same time exporting its excess contractor capacity The BRI which was launched in is aimed at developing the modern day versions of the land based Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road of the st Century Under the initiative China is seeking to improve infrastructure in emerging nations across the world facilitating economic development through companies being able to transport goods more easily and cheaply between countries along various routes Although there has been increasing wariness among governments in emerging markets over the risks of relying heavily on China for funding and construction contracting the opportunities provided under the BRI can be attractive for governments with limited funding capacity and rising infrastructure needs Reflecting the increasing significance of the BRI according to a recent report from the Emerging Markets Forum China has committed or dispersed around US billion in loans since under the initiative compared to US billion by the group of multilateral development banks comprising the World Bank then Development Bank ADB the African Development Bank AfDB and the Inter American Development Bank IDB China s main international funding agencies Export Import Bank of China China Exim Bank and the China Development Bank CDB are funding US billion of infrastructure projects globally that are currently in all stages of development up to and including execution according to the analyst Of the total projects with a combined total of US billion are in execution Railway projects account for the largest share of funding by sector with the Chinese agencies providing a total of US billion Sub Saharan Africa taking US billion and Eastern Europe US billion There is also substantial Chinese funding of oil and gas projects although this is dominated by LNG projects in Russia Power generation projects are a key target for China to expand its influence with China Exim Bank and the CDB combined funding power generations projects with a total value of US billion Key Highlights China s involvement in infrastructure developments globally already goes beyond officially designated BRI and China funded projects according to the analyst Chinese contractors are involved in projects outside China at various stages of development with a total value of US trillion Much of this activity is in South and South East with the total value of projects in which Chinese contractors are involved in the region totaling US billion of which US billion relates to projects already in execution with India Pakistan and Bangladesh being key markets in South The Middle East and North Africa MENA as well as Sub Saharan Africa are also target markets for Chinese contractors In MENA the value of projects in which Chinese contractors are involved totals US billion while in Sub Saharan Africa the value stands at US billion according to the analyst Europe and Latin America are relatively small markets for Chinese contractors but the total values of projects in which Chinese contractors are involved US billion and US billion respectively are still sizeable and a reflection of the increasingly global spread of works However with the recent incorporation of several Latin American countries into the BRI China s influence in Latin America is further strengthening In January China officially invited Latin America to join its BRI as part of its push to include the region into its global reach In the advanced markets of Western Europe and North America as well as China s Northn rivals of Japan and South Korea Chinese contractors face intense domestic competition and are involved in very few projects The EU the US and Japan are also engaged in their own initiatives to broaden their influence and build closer economic ties with key emerging market regions Chinese contractors have expanded their activities internationally at a rapid pace in recent years Based on all projects tracked annual spending on projects outside of China involving Chinese contractors increased from US billion in to US billion in Assuming all projects proceed as planned and that spending is evenly distributed over the execution phase of projects spending is estimated to rise to US billion in before reaching US billion in Spending on projects with Chinese contractors was highest in South East up to but it is projected that Sub Saharan Africa will top the regional list in with spending on these projects totaling US billion ahead of Middle East and North Africa with US billion and South East with US billion Reflecting limited capacity and technological know how of domestic contractors in Sub Saharan Africa Chinese contractors are involved in of the region s infrastructure projects by value with the share being as high as in airport construction projects and in marine and inland water projects mostly port facilities Chinese contractors also have a significant involvement in road and railway projects in Australia but this is owing mainly to John Holland Group being a owned subsidiary of China

report by China org cn on how science helps karst based Maonan ethnic group to harness advantages and characteristics in order to protect the natural environment and reduce poverty Located in a typical karst landscape in a section of southwest China that is home to great numbers of impoverished people Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region suffers from severe rocky desertification and soil erosionand is one of the poorest counties in China The harsh unwelcoming conditions in the administrative area have posed great challenges to its large population over the years Many of its residents made meager livings growing crops like corn and sweet potatoes before poverty alleviation projects were implemented In researchers working at the Institute of Subtropical Agriculture Chinese Academy of Sciences CAS began helping Huanjiang harness advantages and characteristics in order to protect the natural environment and reduce poverty in its borders I began engaging in grassroots level poverty relief work in the county in Huanjiang Deputy Magistrate and CAS researcher Zeng Fuping mentioned recently We had two goals One was to relocate residents who lived in the Mount Dashi area to resettlement sites in locations with more arable land and assist them with new farming endeavors The other involved helping the people who didn t relocate find new ways to make a living Huanjiang has managed to control rocky desertification prevent severe soil erosion and achieve sustainable growth after much trial and error The county implemented a green development plan that balances both economic and environmental factors that was created by the CAS researchers who have been working there and a cattle farm that can accommodate head of cattle was built Many local farmers became involved with the project and began growing high quality forage grass on their land The poverty alleviation model that the CAS researchers developed has helped the county s rural residents become more prosperous and live happier lives The project also functions as an important example for the individuals who have participated in relocation programs in Guangxi and for people who live in other karst regions The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO has recognized the importance of the model and dubbed it the Kenfu model Kenfu resident Wu Liushun is one of the many impoverished villagers who have relocated to the hamlet and benefited from the scientific and technical support that the CAS has provided He explained that researchers working for the academy taught the village s residents new farming techniques and management skills in order to help them escape from poverty and increase their incomes Average net yearly income exceeded yuan US in the Kenfu Huanjiang Ecological Migration Pilot Zone in which was more than the overall figure for the county and the surrounding area and much higher than the less than yuan US that the people who relocated to the resettlement site made in First we began developing mandarin orange orchards on special terraces using techniques that the CAS researchers taught us Wu stated I cultivated the trees on more than a hectare of land We eventually started growing the Orah variety which is a thick skinned cultivar that is suited to the conditions that exist in our area I hope my family and I can lead better lives and my children can go to their dream universities and earn decent livings The corn farms that used to exist in Huanjiang made the county s fragile environment even worse Zeng explained Forage grass and cattle cause less damage to the soil The land that the grass is grown on only needs to be ploughed every eight or nine years or perhaps even every years Erosion is now decreasing naturally Our livestock used to graze on the wild grass in the mountains a cattle farmer living in Huanjiang s Dieling village named Fang Jiuru recalled The high quality forage grass that Zeng and his team introduced is more nutritious than the wild grass that grows here and has better yields I received special training and began working at the cattle farm that was built in order to increase my income Per capita disposal income has risen from about yuan US in to more than yuan US in in rural Huanjiang while consumption expenditures came to an average of about yuan US last year a year on year increase of percent Thescientifically managed farming endeavors that have been pursued in the county have injected vitality into its environmental protection and poverty reduction efforts and the administrative area has become a good example for places with similar problems Some people s incomes have multiplied almost ten fold Zeng noted The research that we conducted has resulted in a new development model that may be useful for the international community Zeng continued We hope to share our successful experiences with controlling rocky desertificationand using science and technology to reduce poverty with people who inhabit karst regions in the countries that participate in the Belt and Road Initiative We want to help them reduce the conflicts thatexist

Future Green Urbanization toward Carbon Neutrality words November Rocky Mountain Institute Releases Report Introducing New Concept of Whole System Zero Emissions Demonstration BEIJING China Nov ewswire PRWeb Today Rocky Mountain Institute RMI released a new report titled Whole System Zero Emissions Demonstration China s Vision on Future Green Urbanization introducing a brand new concept Whole System Zero Emissions Demonstration WS ZED WS ZED will help cities in China implement the country s latest announcement on the pledge of Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality The report provides a theoretical framework and quantitative indicator system to decouple green economic growth from carbon emissions waste and pollution in cities As cities in China go through economic transformation they simultaneously face the challenges of carbon emissions waste management and pollution control Fortunately China has accumulated rich experiences of managing urban growth over the past years across complex natural geography and diverse social conditions Meanwhile globally the urban population is predicted to increase by billion by and the main driver for the new round of urbanization is the global division of labor and industrial transfer As a result carbon emissions of emerging economies are often export driven while waste and pollution remain a domestic issue All three issues are seriously affecting the daily life of everyday people By tackling those three challenges all together for the first time the WS ZED concept goes one step further than net zero carbon and proposes a broader concept to reveal the added value of synergy among net zero carbon net zero waste and net zero pollution This new concept aims to resolve these growth challenges by adopting a holistic approach to put in place urban management policies to combat both climate change and environmental degradation In the report RMI proposes A WS ZED theoretical framework to elaborate the correlation between production living and emissions waste pollution establishing the internal logic for cross sector efforts of mitigation reuse recycle and treatment A WS ZED dual indicator system to support planning decisions and emission benchmarking covering social economic factors planning and design decisions production and living conditions and resources supplies A WS ZED technology landscape to support implementation of early intervention technologies reshaping urban infrastructure to scale up clean energy low carbon industry green mobility efficient buildings and other integrated city governance technologies At present there are as many as new urban development projects being planned in China which are the critical theater for China to implement its national strategy of Carbon Neutrality and Ecological Civilization WS ZED provides a theoretical guidance for an actionable green urbanization model said Yihan Hao main author of the report and manager of RMI The concept of WS ZED and its indicator system can be applied to projects at different scales ranging from km large scale urban zones to campus level technology demonstration projects Our team has carefully proposed more than quantitative indicators as the preliminary attempt to support each project to come up with its own tailor made zero emissions solution This new concept has gained strong buy in from the market and policymakers in China RMI is contributing to the Beijing Administrative Zone Tongzhou District th Five year Plan by introducing the WS ZED concept Beijing Future Science City of Changping District home to research divisions of multiple state owned enterprises in the energy sector has cited WS ZED in its integrated energy planning document to support its strategic goal of establishing global Energy Valley and attracting pioneer energy innovators from the whole world Areas like Tongzhou and Changping are typical examples of urban development zones demonstrating bottom up efforts toward carbon neutrality in line with and supportive of China s national pledge Under China s Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality pledge this new concept focuses on the exploration of an innovative green urbanization model and a brand new development model in the post industrial civilization era said Li Ting managing director and chief representative of RMI China Whole System Zero Emissions

Station in Southeast Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thailand words November BANGKOK Nov ewswire Thailand plans to launch the Bang Sue Grand Station its mega infrastructure project in The station is Thailand s next mega infrastructure project which will not only help ease Bangkok s traffic congestion but also support the country s role as a regional transportation hub Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand states It is positioned to strengthen Thailand s railway system and its connections with the regional transportation network hence enhancing economic growth The Bang Sue Grand Station will replace the grande dame Bangkok Station or Hua Lamphong as the capital s railway hub with a much larger capacity and seamless connectivity to match Thailand s regional ambitions Besides intercity trains it will also serve underground commuter and high speed trains that link Suvarnabhumi Don Mueang and U Tapao international airports The kilometres train route between Don Mueang in Bangkok and U Tapao in Rayong province could be traveled in under an hour ready to transport Bangkokians to hit the Rayong beach in a short period To date the external construction of the station has already been completed and only interior decorations are required for the station to be fully functional by The station covers an area of acres and is set to be the largest railway station in Southeast Standing four stories high with platforms and tracks Bang Sue Grand Station can accommodate to trains at the same time with a daily passenger capacity as high as persons or ten times more than its century old predecessor Hua Lamphong Station Designed to be environmentally friendly the station will have at least green spaces and according to Voravut Mala former Acting Governor of the State Railway of Thailand it will be pollution free since it will serve only electric trains Bang Sue Grand Station will also offer a platform for the first high speed train project the route from Bangkok to Nong Khai The high speed train project is a Thai Sino collaboration to connect Thailand with Lao PDR and China The first phase from Bangkok to Nakhon Ratchasima spanning kilometres is under construction The rest of the route linking Nakhon Ratchasima with Nong Khai covers a distance of kilometres Once completed this project will enable travellers from Bangkok to reach Nong Khai in just three hours time instead of the usual hour train ride or the hour drive on the road Bang Sue Grand Station and Thailand s railway network will therefore enhance ASEAN intraregional connectivity and could in the foreseeable future be extended to link with China s Belt Road Initiative BRI or other prospective bilateral or regional logistical projects Initially the station was planned as an extension of the Red Line Mass Transit System in the national Infrastructure Development Plan Later on authorities expanded the plan transforming the main terminus platform to accommodate various types of rail services Similar to Japan s Tokyo Station and Taiwan s Taipei Main Station Bang Sue Grand Station will act as a new transit hub primed with facilities for future installments of hi tech equipment and system Once the high speed railway to U Tapao is completed it will facilitate travel between Bangkok and the Eastern Economic Corridor EEC a flagship project of Thailand to promote higher valued investments of upgraded industries that are more high tech oriented It will also complement Thailand s prominent tourism industry as well as contribute to urbanisation and the decentralisation of cities expanding economic opportunities beyond city walls For people living in surrounding areas of Bangkok the next generation of rail services will enable them to skip the traffic and hop on the Red Line commuter trains There are two routes in the Red Line the north south Dark Red Line from Ayutthaya to Ratchaburi for a distance of kilometres and the west east Light Red Line connecting Nakhon Pathom with Chacheongsao in kilometres The plan for Bang Sue Grand Station is not limited only to trains and tracks Inspired by the success of Japan in urban development based on railway Thailand hopes to promote Bang Sue Grand Station as a catalyst for developing a New Central Business District around the station The State Railway of Thailand SRT plans to adopt the Transit Oriented Development TOD model into the surrounding the area to draw in more investment in business complexes and residential units This infrastructural elevation will undoubtedly generate a new stream of jobs and income for the local economy At the same time the infamous Bangkok traffic will hopefully ease as a result of a more efficient commuting network subsequently decreasing the number of city dwellers as they spread out to reside outside city areas Completion of this mega project is timely as Thailand and the world is facing a pandemic Mass employment and business opportunities both domestically and regionally could offer a chance for the people and the economy to finally pick up and get back on track Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thailand Ministry of Foreign Affairs Thailand Tel Document egb p Nium Names Frederick

Tbk BRI words October SEMARANG Indonesia Oct ewswire The condition on the edge of Kalisari River on Wonosari road Randusari village South Semarang Subdistrict Semarang City which was once shallow full of garbage is now neatly organized and clean Thanks to the BRI Clean the River program by BRI Bank BRI IDX BBRI the function and role of Kalisari River in Kampung Pelangi has been restored to support the environment and driving the community s economy Currently the presence of Kalisari River in Kampung Pelangi is slowly becoming a new local tourist attraction capable of driving the economy of the surrounding community Not only the residents but the people from other regions also come visiting the area Cleaning activities on Kalisari River are carried out through several activities including cleaning and structuring the river educating the importance of healthy environment empowering and managing waste building facilities and infrastructure on the riverbank and empowering the community s economy through the role of BRILink Agent In collaboration with the local government BRI educates the resident around the river on how to create a healthy environment namely by continuing to encourage changes in people s perspective on the function and role of rivers in their lives and their future A clean and orderly river flow does not only reduce the potential for flooding when it rains but rivers can also have an economic impact and driving the community s economy So far the role of rivers has often been misunderstood only as water channels from upstream to downstream Many people throw garbage into the river Whereas the essence of a river is a hydrological cycle that needs to be preserved Thus in this program BRI collaborates with Bank Sampah Waras to further educate the public in managing household waste It is necessary to select and sort out which waste is organic and which is inorganic to use organic waste for fertilizers agriculture and animal feed to convert inorganic waste in order to provide added value and economic value to society through the recycling process In its management the organic waste that has been sorted from each house will be collected by Bank Sampah Waras to be processed into organic fertilizer compost using a garbage chopper from BRI It takes weeks to convert the waste into compost which then can be used by the residents around the area These fertilizers are also traded commercially to third party with profits that will be managed by Bank Sampah Waras On top of that inorganic waste collection plastic bottles cups plastic bags towel cloth used clothes etc that cannot be recycled will be sold to collectors with the help of the Bank Sampah Waras Meanwhile those that can still be reused will be processed into items that have a selling value such as plastic flowerpots and plastic home decorations The facilities and infrastructure built along the river such as playgrounds and open spaces are now also being used by the

July Many businesses in the Chicagoland that rely on barge transportation have been significantly impacted by the river closure by way of diverted supply chains new supplier qualifications increased material costs and increased freight transportation costs on rail and truck The Army Corps has predicted the Illinois River will be open to traffic by end of October CHICAGO Oct BL Duke River Terminal a division of BL Duke is planning to resume normally scheduled business as repairs to the Illinois Waterway near completion Northbound traffic from Port of NOLA to destinations above La Grange Lock resumed in early October and southbound traffic from Chicago to destinations south of La Grange Lock is expected to resume the first week of November In anticipation for the re opening BL Duke River

infrastructure including upgrading climate control in their sq ft warehouse improving their customer portal and performing needed maintenance on critical equipment We re looking forward to picking up where we left off with existing customers growing existing business and welcoming new customers We don t anticipate the market going back to pre pandemic pre closure levels but we re looking forward to adjusting to a new normal said VP of Business Development Bri Binnie In addition to market demand pressures and COVID impact the scheduled closures to these locks have significantly affected recyclers and terminal services companies as recently documented in Scrap magazine Because the Midwest is a hub for US manufacturing barges are relied upon for cost effective efficient flow of goods One barge tow can transport the equivalent of railcars or truckloads and for a fraction of the freight expense Although the work occurred from July through October the flow of goods stopped at the beginning of June in order to get vessels off that portion of the river and goods will not actually arrive into the Chicagoland area until mid to late November However while there s short term impact the repairs come with long term benefits that will improve the future flow of business It s exciting that the Army Corps is rebuilding the lock and dam system on the Illinois River Updated infrastructure and technology will make barge freight more efficient and reliable by decreasing lock through times and closures These improvements are long overdue said BL Duke President Lou Plucinski The reopening signals a new chapter in the business Parent company BL Duke is celebrating a big milestone this month its th anniversary We ve seen cycles like this before But we re resilient Our

There are more than rivers with pollution level of more than flowing through several areas in Indonesia and these the water is not suitable for community consumption activities The vital role of rivers to support the natural life cycle around them including humans needs to be revitalized The process of revitalizing the river or restoring the functions and benefits of the river is urgent to be
